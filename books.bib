  Abstract                 = {{The optimal control problems studied in this book are governed by state equations of the form $Ay=Bu+f$ and $y'+Ay=Bu+f$, where $A$ is a nonlinear accretive (multivalued) operator in a Banach space $X$, $B$ is a linear continuous operator from a controller space $U$ to $X$, and $u$ is the control parameter. The cost functional is in general not differentiable, and since the state equation is nonlinear this leads to a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem. The book is written in a dual perspective, analysis-synthesis taking into account that in contemporary mathematics control theory is complementarily related to the analysis of differential systems.\par The first chapter contains preliminaries, and the second one deals with nonlinear operators of monotone type. Chapter 3 is concerned with optimal control problems governed by variational inequalities of elliptic type and semilinear elliptic equations. The main emphasis is put on first order necessary conditions of optimality obtained by an approximating regularizing process. The general theory is applied to controlled free boundary problems such as the obstacle problem and the Signorini problem. Chapter 4 is devoted to the Cauchy problem associated with nonlinear accretive operators in Banach space. The main result is related to the Crandall-Liggett exponential formula for autonomous equations. Applications are given to nonlinear parabolic equations and variational inequalities, first order quasilinear equations, the nonlinear diffusion equations, and nonlinear hyperbolic equations. Optimal control problems governed by semilinear parabolic equations and by parabolic variational inequalities are considered in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 is concerned with the feedback representation of optimal controllers to problems considered in the previous chapter.\par The book contains an extensive list of references and every chapter is concluded by very interesting bibliographical notes and remarks.}},

  Title                    = {{Functional analysis, Sobolev spaces and partial differential equations}},
  Author                   = {Brezis, Haim},

  Year                     = {2011},

  Abstract                 = {{Functional analysis evolved as the natural gathering point for a number of different investigations into the solvability of many classes of problems, including differential or partial differential equations or linear equations which are either in the form of integral equations or in the form of countable systems of linear scalar equations in which the unknown is a sequence of numbers. As the subject developed, much broader areas of applicability became evident. These applications, in turn, spawned further abstract development, and the abstract results themselves assumed an intrinsic interest. A previous version of this book, originally published in 1983 in French [{\it H. Brezis}, ``Analyse fonctionnelle. Th\'eorie et applications'' (Collection Math\'ematiques Appliqu\'ees pour la Ma\^{\i}trise; Paris: Masson) (1983; Zbl 0511.46001)] and followed by numerous translations, became very popular worldwide, and was adopted as a textbook in many European universities. A deficiency of the French text was the lack of exercises. The present volume contains a wealth of problems. The author's aim is to give a systematic treatment of some of the fundamental abstract results in functional analysis and of their applications to certain concrete problems in linear differential and partial differential equations. Moreover, by interlacing extensive commentary and foreshadowing subsequent developments within the formal scheme of statements and proofs, by the inclusion of many apt examples and by appending interesting and challenging exercises, the author has written a book which is eminently suitable as a text for a graduate course. This volume is distinguished by the broad variety of problems which have been treated and by the abstract results which are developed. The content of the book is divided into 11 chapters, as follows: I. The Hahn-Banach theorems. Introduction to the theory of conjugate convex functions; II. The Banach-Steinhaus and closed graph theorems. Orthogonality relations. Unbounded operators. The notion of adjoint. Characterization of surjective operators; III. Weak topologies. Reflexive spaces. Separable spaces. Uniformly convex spaces; IV. $L^p$-spaces; V. Hilbert spaces; VI. Compact operators. Spectral decomposition of compact selfadjoint operators; VII. The Hille-Yosida theorem; VIII. Sobolev spaces and variational formulation of boundary value problems in dimension one; IX. Sobolev spaces and variational formulation of boundary value problems in dimension $N$; X. Evolution problems: the heat equation and the wave equation; XI. Miscellaneous Complements. Following Chapter XI, there are solutions for selected exercises (a significant number of complete solutions for the exercises following each chapter are included). Next, a list of 51 problems follows. These are mostly theorems, or otherwise theoretical results, the proofs of which could be treated separately from the main text. Finally, there is a section of hints and partial solutions for the set of 51 problems. In summary, this book is a tour-de-force by the author, who is a master of modern nonlinear functional analysis and who has contributed extensively to the development of the theory of partial differential equations. The volume under review deals rigorously with mathematical models of a certain applicability to the real world. From this viewpoint, it is a significant contribution to a currently active area of research. Globally, the reviewer very much likes the spirit and the scope of the book. The writing is lively, the material is diverse and maintains a strong unity. The interplay between the abstract functional analysis and relevant concrete problems arising in applications is emphasized throughout. On balance, the book is a very useful contribution to the growing literature on this circle of ideas. I wholeheartedly recommend this book both as a textbook, and for independent study.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The monograph deals with problems of nonlinear systems analysis. The author examines bilinear control systems as time-invariant nonlinear systems with control inputs that appear as coefficients. At first the author introduces definitions of bilinear systems and transition matrices and basics in linear dynamical systems analysis comparable to bilinear systems. Later the author shows that the set of transition matrices for bilinear control systems with piece-wise control is a Lie group. This makes a geometric treatment of bilinear systems possible. Chapter 3 explores stabilization and control of bilinear systems. It contains necessary and sufficient conditions for stabilization of planar systems with constant controls and gives some facts about controllability, geometry of attainable sets and some easy theorems. Results of Chapter 2 and 3 are expanded on discrete-time bilinear systems and systems with outputs. Examples of non-controllable two-dimensional bilinear control systems is presented whose Euler discretizations are controllable on the plane. Examples of bilinear control systems have been given in a separate chapter. The author examines also problems of dynamical systems linearization and some cases of inputs including inputs as stochastic processes. Main results are illustrated by examples, proofs are given or cited. Appendices A-D contain standard facts about matrices, Lie groups and Lie algebras that are helpful for readers.}},

Explicit choices are discussed for indices $m=1,2,3$ (systems in normal form have index $m=0)$. Numerical results are presented for a number of interesting applications. A new code RADAU 5 in Fortran is presented for a 3-stage Radau IIA Runge-Kutta method which is applicable for indices $m=1,2,3.$ \par Given a system of differential equations in implicit form $F(Y',Y)=0$ the equation has perturbation index m along a solution Y on [0,b] if for all Z near Y the defect $\delta (x)=F(Z',Z)$ satisfies $$ \Vert Z(x)- Y(x)\Vert \le C(\Vert Z(0)-Y(0)\Vert +\sum\sp{m-1}\sb{j=0}\max\sb{0\le t\le x}\Vert \delta\sp{(j)}(t)\Vert). $$ The authors employ the following canonical forms for systems with indices $m=1,2,3:$ 1) $m=1$, $y'=f(y,z),\quad g(y,z)=0$ and $g\sb z$ is invertible. 2) $m=2$, $y'=f(y,z),\quad g(y)=0,$ and $g\sb yf\sb z$ has a bounded inverse. 3) $m=3$, $y'=f(y,z),\quad z'=k(y,z,u),\quad 0=g(y,u)$ and $g\sb yf\sb zk\sb u$ has a bounded inverse. Which Runge-Kutta algorithm may be applied to a system depends on which of these forms it assumes. The applicable implicit Runge-Kutta methods are classified following {\it J. C. Butcher} [The numerical analysis of ordinary differential equations (1987; Zbl 0616.65072)] and {\it K. Dekker} and {\it J. G. Verwer} [Stability of Runge-Kutta methods for stiff nonlinear differential equations (1984; Zbl 0571.65057)] according to whether Gauss, Radau, or Lobatto quadrature is used. The specific algorithms considered are Gauss, Radau IA, IIA, and Lobatto IIIA, IIIC. In addition singly diagonal methods of {\it R. Alexander} [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 14, 1006-1021 (1977; Zbl 0374.65038)] and of {\it S. P. N{\o}rsett} and {\it P. Thomsen} [BIT 26, 100-113 (1986; Zbl 0627.65082)] are covered. \par The notion of perturbation index and the classification of differential- algebraic systems is presented in chapter 1. Chapter 2 contains a review of Runge-Kutta methods for ordinary differential and differential- algebraic equations including methods for singularly perturbed systems. Chapters 3-6 select and describe methods appropriate respectively for indices $m=1,2,3$. Proofs of convergence of the methods are presented including convergence for associated perturbed systems. Chapter 7 presents a simplified Newton method applicable to the relevant algorithms and chapter 8 concerns local error estimation. In chapter 9 a summary of numerical results is given for a number of interesting applications and chapter 10 presents the code RADAU 5. \par The material presented in the monograph represents recent research by many authors which is published here for the first time in a unified form. A comprehensive bibliography and index are included.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This book gives an introduction to optimization methods for unconstrained and bound constrained minimization problems. The style of the book is probably best described by the following quote from the book's preface: `\dots{} we treat a small number of methods in depth, giving less detailed description of only a few [\dots{}]. We aim for clarity and brevity rather than complete generality and confine our scope to algorithms that are easy to implement (by the reader!) and understand.' \par This book is partitioned into two parts. The first part, occupying approximately 100 pages, is devoted to the optimization of smooth functions. The methods studied in this first part rely on the availability and accuracy of first order, and sometimes also second order derivatives of the objective function. The first part contains five chapters. The first chapter provides basic concepts. It also introduces a parameter identification problem and a discretized optimal control problem, both of which are used to demonstrate all methods discussed in the first part. Chapter 2 studies the local convergence of Newton's method, inexact Newton methods, and the Gauss-Newton method for the solution of nonlinear least squares problems. Both, overdetermined and underdetermined nonlinear least squares problems are considered. Chapter 3 is devoted to line-search and trust-region methods, which are used to globalize convergence, i.e., remove the restriction that the starting point of the optimization iteration is sufficiently close to a solution. \par The BFGS method is studied in chapter 4. A local convergence analysis is provided and implementation details are discussed. Other quasi-Newton methods are sketched. The last chapter of the first part, chapter 5, studies projection methods for the solution of bound constrained problems. All chapters conclude with a demonstration of the methods discussed in the respective chapter using the parameter identification problem and the discretized optimal control problem introduced in chapter 1, and with a set of exercises. \par The second part of the book, which is approximately 50 pages long, deals with the optimization of noisy functions. Such optimization problems arise, e.g., when the evaluation of the objective function involves computer simulations. In such cases the noise often introduces artificial minimizers. Gradient information, even if available, cannot expected to be reliable. This second part contains three chapters. The first chapter provides a discussion of noisy functions, basics concepts, and three simple examples that are later used to demonstrate the behavior of optimization algorithms. Chapter 7 introduces implicit filtering, a technique due to the author and his group. Implicit filtering methods use finite difference approximations of the gradient, which are adjusted to the noise level in the function. Direct search algorithms, including the Nelder-Mead, multidirectional search, and the Hooke-Jeves algorithms are discussed in Chapter 8. Again, the latter two chapters conclude with a numerical demonstration of the methods discussed in the respective chapter, and with a set of exercises. \par The treatment of both, optimization methods for smooth and for noisy functions is a unique feature of this book. Matlab implementations of all algorithms discussed in this book are easily accessible from the author's or the publisher's web-page.}},

A lot of results are new, and for each of these recent results the complete and self-contained proofs are given. The author does not demand from the reader technical prerequisites other than a basic training in nonlinear partial differential equations. Firstly, he recalls the fundamental equations modeling Newtonian fluids together with the basic approximated and simplified models. Then the most general existence results for density-dependent Navier-Stokes equations are presented along with the discussion on regularity and uniqueness, on stationary problems, and mentioning a number of open questions.\par Deep analysis is applied to the classical Navier-Stokes equations for homogeneous fluids. Namely, the celebrated results of J. Leray concerning the global existence of weak solutions are deduced, and some recent regularity results in three dimensions are thoroughly treated as well. A great attention is devoted to the classical Euler equations. The author first recalls the state of the art of this model, then compares the multiple notions of weak solutions and shows their existence and uniqueness for the two-dimensional case. Next, he discusses the open question concerning a priori estimates in three dimensions and gives some examples. Finally, some approaches to proving global existence in a supergeneralized weak sense are studied, and density-dependent Euler equations and hydrostatic approximation models are analyzed. In the appendices various useful technical results are presented for the reader's convenience.\par Summarizing the impression of this interesting book, it is worth pointing out that it is written in an easy-reading fashion along with the deep and comprehensive analysis of the topics which are at the highest level of the importance in the modern theory of nonlinear differential equations.}},

Its rigorous treatment of the main topics in the system identification field should appeal to the mathematically-minded reader. The book addresses to all of those who want to get a firm grip on the basic system identification techniques that are currently available. The book contains 17 chapters and 2 appendices, which are briefly reviewed in the following. \par Part i: Systems and models \par Chapter 1 introduces, in an informal way, the basic entities of an identification exercise. Chapter 2 discusses time-invariant linear systems described by impulse responses and transfer functions, and introduces some basic notions on signal spectra and description of the disturbances. Chapter 3 discusses three main applications in which a system description is useful: simulation, prediction and control. Chapter 4 introduces a general family of transfer-function and state-space models and derives a number of results on their identifiability properties. Chapter 5 contains a brief discussion about time-varying and nonlinear models. \par Part ii: Methods \par Chapter 6 presents several nonparametric time- and frequency-domain methods, such as transient analysis, correlation analysis, Fourier and spectral analysis. Chapter 7 describes two general methods for parameter estimation: the prediction error method (PEM) and the correlation method (CM), which are shown to contain many other estimation methods as special cases. Chapter 8 establishes the consistency and identifiability properties of PEM and CM, and Chapter 9 derives the asymptotic distributions of the parameter estimates provided by these two general methods. Chapters 10 and 11 discuss various off-line and, respectively, on-line techniques to compute the PEM and CM estimates, and analyse the main problems associated with these techniques (such as convergence, numerical accuracy and fast implementation). \par Part iii: User's choice \par Chapter 12 discusses the options and objectives that a user of system identification methods may have. Chapters 13, 14 and 15 attempt to provide some general answers to such important problems as experiment design and choice of an identification criterion. Chapter 16 discusses various techniques for model structure selection and model validation, and Chapter 17 presents two identification exercises. Finally, Appendix I contains a brief discussion of some concepts from the probability theory, and Appendix II presents the basic results on linear regressions.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The book provides an excellent survey of theoretical results on finite-dimensional functional analysis. The Newton method for solving nonlinear systems surves as a basis where a variety of its modifications is presented, problems related to local and global convergence are studied, iterative methods for numerical solutions are considered. \par The book includes five parts, subdivided in fourteen chapters, a bibliography involving about 850 papers and books, an Index and a Glossary of symbols. Each chapter is subdivided in sections, most of which are supplemented with ``Notes and Remarks'' giving some additional results to the problems discussed as well as a specified list of references. There are also exercises included which make the book very useful for graduate students and others working in this field. \par Part I (Chapters 1 to 3) has an introductory character. It collects background material from analysis and linear algebra used in following parts. Chapter 1 presents several typical mathematical problems leading to solutions of nonlinear systems. Chapter 2 is devoted to linear algebra problems such as eigenvalue problems, matrix norms, invertibility of linear operators in $\bbfR^n$, partial order relations. Chapter 3 includes $n$-dimensional calculus, G\^ateaux and Fr\'echet derivatives, convex functionals and their properties. \par Part II (Chapters 4 to 6) presents various existence and uniqueness theorems with nonconstructive proofs. Chapter 4 studies gradient operators, rising from minimization problems as well as convex functionals. In Chapter 5, contraction mapping theorems for inverse and implicit function are proved and continuations of local homeomorphisms to global ones are considered. Chapter 6 is devoted to the theory of the degree of a mapping, which allows simple proofs of known fixed point theorems and is used to study monotone and coercive mappings. \par Part III (Chapters 7 and 8) describes the most common iterative methods for solving systems of nonlinear equations. In Chapter 7, the Newton's method, the secant and Steffensen methods as well as their variations are discussed. Iterative methods for linear systems are generalized to and applied to nonlinear problems. Continuation methods for the study of existence problems of operator equations are also discussed. Chapter 8 is devoted to minimization problems, including the gradient and conjugate gradient iterations. \par Part IV (Chapters 9 to 11) discusses local convergence and convergence order of iterative processes. In Chapter 9 two different measures the $Q$- and $R$-factors of the asymptotic rate of convergence for sequences and iterative processes are introduced. Chapter 10 presents results on local convergence and rate of convergence for one-step stationary iterations; for the Newton method, for the $m$-step Newton-SOR and $m$-step SOR-Newton and some of the minimization methods from Chapter 8. Chapter 11 considers multistep iteration methods as well as one-step nonstationary iterations to which the techniques from previous chapter do not apply. The main examples are secant-type methods, modified Newton iterations and variable-step generalized linear iterations. Results on point of attraction and rate of convergence are derived as well. \par Part V (Chapter 12 to 14) discusses problems on about existence of a solution $x^\ast $ to $Fx=0$ in the case of convergence of the iterations, about the choice of initial approximations for $x^\ast$ and on estimations of the error after stopping the iterations. Chapter 12 is devoted to generalizations of contraction mapping theorems, approximate contractions and sequences of contractions, nonlinear majorants of contractions. The results are applied to Newton's method. While Chapter 12 is based on the usage of norms in $\bbfR^n$, in Chapter 13 $\bbfR^n$ is considered to be a partially ordered linear space and all results show monotonic convergence of the iterates. The last Chapter 14 presents minimization methods for real functionals in $\bbfR^n$. Considered are gradient and gradient-related methods, Newton-type methods, conjugate direction methods, univariate relaxation processes. \par The first edition of the book was published in 1970 (see Zbl 0241.65046). The present new edition is equipped with a Preface, where the authors indicate ``some of the principle developments and changes'' and give some recent books and papers related to topics considered.}},

Many chapters contain relevant examples and exercises, as well as useful bibliographical remarks. Some of the abstract tools reviewed in the monograph are: pseudomonotone or weakly continuous mappings, accretive operators, nonlinear semigroups, set-valued mappings, and compactness methods. Specific partial differential equations or systems of partial differential equations that are discussed include semilinear heat equations, quasilinear elliptic equations of divergence type, reaction-diffusion systems, Navier-Stokes equations, doubly nonlinear problems, and phase-field models. The book is well written and represents a valuable addition to the literature.

  Abstract                 = {{The second volume (chapters 18-36) of Zeidler's treatise is a broad and up-to-date survey of the monotone operator theory, a popular and successful research area of nonlinear analysis, over the past 25 years. In comparison with the German original (1979; Zbl 0426.47032 and 1981; Zbl 0481.47041) the number of pages of its English augmented translation has been increased five times; this compelled the publisher to divide the content into two subvolumes, which form a unit. The first subvolume, devoted to linear positive (monotone) operators, is a competent introduction to Hilbert space methods in PDE theory. As a prelude to the subject, Hilbert orthogonality and the Ritz method, as well as an elegant functional analytic foundation of quadratic variational problems are presented. More attention is paid to the Friedrichs extension for unbounded linear operators and its consequences for eigenvalue problems and the semigroup approach of evolution problems (mild solutions). Completion and smoothing principles and relationships between stability, consistency, and convergence in difference methods have been added. \par The second part of the first subvolume deals with the approximation- solvability of linear operator equations and the convergence of the Galerkin method. Hilbert space methods are successively implemented to elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic problems, whose peculiarities are emphasized. New topics on functional and interpolation inequalities, and regularity of generalized solutions are developed. Sufficient rules for strongly positive bilinear forms, existence of eigenvalues, and the Fredholm alternative are interacted to investigate the boundary value problems for elliptic equations. Along this perspective, the monotone mappings appear as a natural tool, extending Hilbert space methods to nonlinear problems. Moreover, monotone operator machinery yields a rigorous justification of the Dirichlet principle, based on the fundamental concept of energy. \par After a digest of the basic ideas in the theory of monotone operators, the second subvolume develops by progressive stages the implementation of monotone operators to stationary and nonstationary problems. Upon general hypotheses, quasilinear elliptic or nonlinear integral Hammerstein equations can be rewritten as functional equations involving monotone- like operators. Furthermore, the pseudomonotone operator theory unifies compactness and monotonicity arguments. With nonlinear Fredholm alternative are now associated noncoercive problems, the Ces\`ari method and the Landesman-Lazer principle, a main bifurcation theorem, as well as continuation and multiplicity results. The core of the second subvolume emphasizes the efficiency of monotonicity arguments, nonlinear semigroups and the Galerkin method in the study of nonlinear evolution equations. Kato's new results on semibounded evolutions, generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, or Amann's look at quasilinear parabolic problems regarded as dynamical systems are mentioned. A more constituent additional attribute of monotone operators is their maximality. Maximal monotone (set-valued) mappings have significant properties and applications to variational problems and inequalities or to Hammerstein equations. Their structure is based on both the Galerkin method and the regularization procedure via duality map. Special monotone mapping subclasses with nice features, such as angle-bounded and 3-monotone operators, are described. Key theorems about pseudomonotone perturbations of maximal monotone mappings and basic geometric elements concerning ranges of sums of monotone operators are inserted. Recent progress in semilinear wave equations and generalized viscosity solutions are interconnected with the Galerkin method for second-order evolution equations. Discretization methods, inner and external approximation schemes, for nonlinear equations are theorized in the last part of the volume. This leads naturally to the introduction of A-proper mappings, for which a multivalued topological degree is defined. For the convenience of the reader, an appendix summarizes the frequently used notion in measure and integration theory, discrete Sobolev spaces, functional calculus of selfadjoint operators, interpolation theory of function spaces, fractional powers of sectorial operators, Hausdorff measure and fractals, etc. Besides, many suggestive schematic overviews explain the interrelations between fundamental ideas, concepts and results in nonlinear operator theory. Since the proposed subject is too ample, the author has often chosen an intermediate way between monograph and directory. Each chapter closes with complementary problems and references, orienting the reader to current research trends. Moreover, a comprehensive bibliography of more than 40 pages concludes the book. Like in other previously published parts of this five-volume encyclopaedic series (Part I: 1986; Zbl 0583.47050; Part III: 1985; Zbl 0583.47051 and Part IV: 1988; Zbl 0648.47036), the lecturer enjoys reading the many quotations and remarks made by outstanding scientists or writers on the topics covered in the various chapters. It should also be emphasized that the author's approach goes straight to a numerical functional analysis with applications to finite elements methods in Sobolev spaces. \par All in all, this book is an excellent readable introduction in the prevalent classes of nonlinear operators. A large audience of mathematicians and natural scientists will find it a stimulating guide through the contemporary operator treatment of nonlinear partial differential and integral equations.}},

The first three volumes are a translated extension of the German original [(1976; Zbl 0326.47053 and 1980; Zbl 0434.47042)]. Although the titles of the chapters are changed according to the new enlarged content, the succession of the basic topics is almost unaltered. That is why, after some general considerations on the entire work, we will point out only certain augmented sections which we feel to be more significant in contemporary nonlinar analysis. As distinct from the lecture note schemes of the German version, every chapter in the English translation has a flowing, coherent form and contains nice comments, overviews, and perspectives on the strategy and implementations of the considered procedures, and is concluded with complementary problems. Moreover, at the end of each volume there is a comprehensive and up-to- date bibliography. \par The work is clearly written and organized so that each chapter can be independently approached. The survey of the basic features of most topics of nonlinear functional analysis makes Zeidler's treatise, more than any other recent books concerning this subject, a deskbook for a broad range of researchers as well as a guide for many graduate courses. \par The first volume (chapters 1-17) describes what fixed-point theory actually means. In the part that deals with general principles and applications, more emphasis is placed on iterative methods, generalizations of the implicit function theorem, super- and subsolutions, the nonlinear Krein-Rutman theorem, multiple solutions, the Ljapunov-Schmidt branching equations, the generic and Hopf bifurcation, minimax theorems, Michael's selection theorem and differential inclusions, the Bourbaki-Kneser theorem. In the context of the degree theory one also studies the fixed-point index and eigenvalue principle, Leray's product rule and homeomorphisms, continuation principles in the topological bifurcation theory.}},
