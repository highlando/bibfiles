@BOOK{Bar93,
  title = {Analysis and control of nonlinear infinite dimensional systems},
  publisher = {Academic Press},
  year = {1993},
  author = {Barbu, Viorel},
  address = {Boston},
  abstract = {{The optimal control problems studied in this book are governed by
	state equations of the form $Ay=Bu+f$ and $y'+Ay=Bu+f$, where $A$
	is a nonlinear accretive (multivalued) operator in a Banach space
	$X$, $B$ is a linear continuous operator from a controller space
	$U$ to $X$, and $u$ is the control parameter. The cost functional
	is in general not differentiable, and since the state equation is
	nonlinear this leads to a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem.
	The book is written in a dual perspective, analysis-synthesis taking
	into account that in contemporary mathematics control theory is complementarily
	related to the analysis of differential systems.\par The first chapter
	contains preliminaries, and the second one deals with nonlinear operators
	of monotone type. Chapter 3 is concerned with optimal control problems
	governed by variational inequalities of elliptic type and semilinear
	elliptic equations. The main emphasis is put on first order necessary
	conditions of optimality obtained by an approximating regularizing
	process. The general theory is applied to controlled free boundary
	problems such as the obstacle problem and the Signorini problem.
	Chapter 4 is devoted to the Cauchy problem associated with nonlinear
	accretive operators in Banach space. The main result is related to
	the Crandall-Liggett exponential formula for autonomous equations.
	Applications are given to nonlinear parabolic equations and variational
	inequalities, first order quasilinear equations, the nonlinear diffusion
	equations, and nonlinear hyperbolic equations. Optimal control problems
	governed by semilinear parabolic equations and by parabolic variational
	inequalities are considered in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 is concerned
	with the feedback representation of optimal controllers to problems
	considered in the previous chapter.\par The book contains an extensive
	list of references and every chapter is concluded by very interesting
	bibliographical notes and remarks.}},

@BOOK{Bre11,
  title = {{Functional analysis, Sobolev spaces and partial differential equations}},
  publisher = {Springer},
  year = {2011},
  author = {Brezis, Haim},
  abstract = {{Functional analysis evolved as the natural gathering point for a
	number of different investigations into the solvability of many classes
	of problems, including differential or partial differential equations
	or linear equations which are either in the form of integral equations
	or in the form of countable systems of linear scalar equations in
	which the unknown is a sequence of numbers. As the subject developed,
	much broader areas of applicability became evident. These applications,
	in turn, spawned further abstract development, and the abstract results
	themselves assumed an intrinsic interest. A previous version of this
	book, originally published in 1983 in French [{\it H. Brezis}, ``Analyse
	fonctionnelle. Th\'eorie et applications'' (Collection Math\'ematiques
	Appliqu\'ees pour la Ma\^{\i}trise; Paris: Masson) (1983; Zbl 0511.46001)]
	and followed by numerous translations, became very popular worldwide,
	and was adopted as a textbook in many European universities. A deficiency
	of the French text was the lack of exercises. The present volume
	contains a wealth of problems. The author's aim is to give a systematic
	treatment of some of the fundamental abstract results in functional
	analysis and of their applications to certain concrete problems in
	linear differential and partial differential equations. Moreover,
	by interlacing extensive commentary and foreshadowing subsequent
	developments within the formal scheme of statements and proofs, by
	the inclusion of many apt examples and by appending interesting and
	challenging exercises, the author has written a book which is eminently
	suitable as a text for a graduate course. This volume is distinguished
	by the broad variety of problems which have been treated and by the
	abstract results which are developed. The content of the book is
	divided into 11 chapters, as follows: I. The Hahn-Banach theorems.
	Introduction to the theory of conjugate convex functions; II. The
	Banach-Steinhaus and closed graph theorems. Orthogonality relations.
	Unbounded operators. The notion of adjoint. Characterization of surjective
	operators; III. Weak topologies. Reflexive spaces. Separable spaces.
	Uniformly convex spaces; IV. $L^p$-spaces; V. Hilbert spaces; VI.
	Compact operators. Spectral decomposition of compact selfadjoint
	operators; VII. The Hille-Yosida theorem; VIII. Sobolev spaces and
	variational formulation of boundary value problems in dimension one;
	IX. Sobolev spaces and variational formulation of boundary value
	problems in dimension $N$; X. Evolution problems: the heat equation
	and the wave equation; XI. Miscellaneous Complements. Following Chapter
	XI, there are solutions for selected exercises (a significant number
	of complete solutions for the exercises following each chapter are
	included). Next, a list of 51 problems follows. These are mostly
	theorems, or otherwise theoretical results, the proofs of which could
	be treated separately from the main text. Finally, there is a section
	of hints and partial solutions for the set of 51 problems. In summary,
	this book is a tour-de-force by the author, who is a master of modern
	nonlinear functional analysis and who has contributed extensively
	to the development of the theory of partial differential equations.
	The volume under review deals rigorously with mathematical models
	of a certain applicability to the real world. From this viewpoint,
	it is a significant contribution to a currently active area of research.
	Globally, the reviewer very much likes the spirit and the scope of
	the book. The writing is lively, the material is diverse and maintains
	a strong unity. The interplay between the abstract functional analysis
	and relevant concrete problems arising in applications is emphasized
	throughout. On balance, the book is a very useful contribution to
	the growing literature on this circle of ideas. I wholeheartedly
	recommend this book both as a textbook, and for independent study.}},

	The author examines bilinear control systems as time-invariant nonlinear
	systems with control inputs that appear as coefficients. At first
	the author introduces definitions of bilinear systems and transition
	matrices and basics in linear dynamical systems analysis comparable
	to bilinear systems. Later the author shows that the set of transition
	matrices for bilinear control systems with piece-wise control is
	a Lie group. This makes a geometric treatment of bilinear systems
	possible. Chapter 3 explores stabilization and control of bilinear
	systems. It contains necessary and sufficient conditions for stabilization
	of planar systems with constant controls and gives some facts about
	controllability, geometry of attainable sets and some easy theorems.
	Results of Chapter 2 and 3 are expanded on discrete-time bilinear
	systems and systems with outputs. Examples of non-controllable two-dimensional
	bilinear control systems is presented whose Euler discretizations
	are controllable on the plane. Examples of bilinear control systems
	have been given in a separate chapter. The author examines also problems
	of dynamical systems linearization and some cases of inputs including

  author = {Hairer, Ernst and Lubich, Christian and Roche, Michel},
  address = {Berlin},
  abstract = {{In this monograph the authors systematically study application of
	implicit and semi-explicit Runge-Kutta methods for discrete approximation
	to differential-algebraic systems of ordinary differential equations.
	Applications to singularly perturbed systems are also included. The
	systems are classified according to the permutation index of the
	system, i.e. the behavior of the residual under a small perturbation
	of the solution. \par It is shown that the appropriate choice of
	the Runge-Kutta method depends directly on the index of the system.
	Explicit choices are discussed for indices $m=1,2,3$ (systems in
	normal form have index $m=0)$. Numerical results are presented for
	a number of interesting applications. A new code RADAU 5 in Fortran
	is presented for a 3-stage Radau IIA Runge-Kutta method which is
	applicable for indices $m=1,2,3.$ \par Given a system of differential
	equations in implicit form $F(Y',Y)=0$ the equation has perturbation
	index m along a solution Y on [0,b] if for all Z near Y the defect
	$\delta (x)=F(Z',Z)$ satisfies $$ \Vert Z(x)- Y(x)\Vert \le C(\Vert
	Z(0)-Y(0)\Vert +\sum\sp{m-1}\sb{j=0}\max\sb{0\le t\le x}\Vert \delta\sp{(j)}(t)\Vert).
	$$ The authors employ the following canonical forms for systems with
	indices $m=1,2,3:$ 1) $m=1$, $y'=f(y,z),\quad g(y,z)=0$ and $g\sb
	z$ is invertible. 2) $m=2$, $y'=f(y,z),\quad g(y)=0,$ and $g\sb yf\sb
	z$ has a bounded inverse. 3) $m=3$, $y'=f(y,z),\quad z'=k(y,z,u),\quad
	0=g(y,u)$ and $g\sb yf\sb zk\sb u$ has a bounded inverse. Which Runge-Kutta
	algorithm may be applied to a system depends on which of these forms
	it assumes. The applicable implicit Runge-Kutta methods are classified
	following {\it J. C. Butcher} [The numerical analysis of ordinary
	differential equations (1987; Zbl 0616.65072)] and {\it K. Dekker}
	and {\it J. G. Verwer} [Stability of Runge-Kutta methods for stiff
	nonlinear differential equations (1984; Zbl 0571.65057)] according
	to whether Gauss, Radau, or Lobatto quadrature is used. The specific
	algorithms considered are Gauss, Radau IA, IIA, and Lobatto IIIA,
	IIIC. In addition singly diagonal methods of {\it R. Alexander} [SIAM
	J. Numer. Anal. 14, 1006-1021 (1977; Zbl 0374.65038)] and of {\it
	S. P. N{\o}rsett} and {\it P. Thomsen} [BIT 26, 100-113 (1986; Zbl
	0627.65082)] are covered. \par The notion of perturbation index and
	the classification of differential- algebraic systems is presented
	in chapter 1. Chapter 2 contains a review of Runge-Kutta methods
	for ordinary differential and differential- algebraic equations including
	methods for singularly perturbed systems. Chapters 3-6 select and
	describe methods appropriate respectively for indices $m=1,2,3$.
	Proofs of convergence of the methods are presented including convergence
	for associated perturbed systems. Chapter 7 presents a simplified
	Newton method applicable to the relevant algorithms and chapter 8
	concerns local error estimation. In chapter 9 a summary of numerical
	results is given for a number of interesting applications and chapter
	10 presents the code RADAU 5. \par The material presented in the

  abstract = {{This book gives an introduction to optimization methods for unconstrained
	and bound constrained minimization problems. The style of the book
	is probably best described by the following quote from the book's
	preface: `\dots{} we treat a small number of methods in depth, giving
	less detailed description of only a few [\dots{}]. We aim for clarity
	and brevity rather than complete generality and confine our scope
	to algorithms that are easy to implement (by the reader!) and understand.'
	\par This book is partitioned into two parts. The first part, occupying
	approximately 100 pages, is devoted to the optimization of smooth
	functions. The methods studied in this first part rely on the availability
	and accuracy of first order, and sometimes also second order derivatives
	of the objective function. The first part contains five chapters.
	The first chapter provides basic concepts. It also introduces a parameter
	identification problem and a discretized optimal control problem,
	both of which are used to demonstrate all methods discussed in the
	first part. Chapter 2 studies the local convergence of Newton's method,
	inexact Newton methods, and the Gauss-Newton method for the solution
	of nonlinear least squares problems. Both, overdetermined and underdetermined
	nonlinear least squares problems are considered. Chapter 3 is devoted
	to line-search and trust-region methods, which are used to globalize
	convergence, i.e., remove the restriction that the starting point
	of the optimization iteration is sufficiently close to a solution.
	\par The BFGS method is studied in chapter 4. A local convergence
	analysis is provided and implementation details are discussed. Other
	quasi-Newton methods are sketched. The last chapter of the first
	part, chapter 5, studies projection methods for the solution of bound
	constrained problems. All chapters conclude with a demonstration
	of the methods discussed in the respective chapter using the parameter
	identification problem and the discretized optimal control problem
	introduced in chapter 1, and with a set of exercises. \par The second
	part of the book, which is approximately 50 pages long, deals with
	the optimization of noisy functions. Such optimization problems arise,
	e.g., when the evaluation of the objective function involves computer
	simulations. In such cases the noise often introduces artificial
	minimizers. Gradient information, even if available, cannot expected
	to be reliable. This second part contains three chapters. The first
	chapter provides a discussion of noisy functions, basics concepts,
	and three simple examples that are later used to demonstrate the

	linear systems described by impulse responses and transfer functions,
	and introduces some basic notions on signal spectra and description
	of the disturbances. Chapter 3 discusses three main applications
	in which a system description is useful: simulation, prediction and
	control. Chapter 4 introduces a general family of transfer-function
	and state-space models and derives a number of results on their identifiability
	properties. Chapter 5 contains a brief discussion about time-varying
	and nonlinear models. \par Part ii: Methods \par Chapter 6 presents
	several nonparametric time- and frequency-domain methods, such as
	transient analysis, correlation analysis, Fourier and spectral analysis.
	Chapter 7 describes two general methods for parameter estimation:
	the prediction error method (PEM) and the correlation method (CM),
	which are shown to contain many other estimation methods as special
	cases. Chapter 8 establishes the consistency and identifiability

	functional analysis. The Newton method for solving nonlinear systems
	surves as a basis where a variety of its modifications is presented,
	problems related to local and global convergence are studied, iterative
	methods for numerical solutions are considered. \par The book includes
	five parts, subdivided in fourteen chapters, a bibliography involving
	about 850 papers and books, an Index and a Glossary of symbols. Each
	chapter is subdivided in sections, most of which are supplemented
	with ``Notes and Remarks'' giving some additional results to the
	problems discussed as well as a specified list of references. There
	are also exercises included which make the book very useful for graduate
	students and others working in this field. \par Part I (Chapters
	1 to 3) has an introductory character. It collects background material
	from analysis and linear algebra used in following parts. Chapter
	1 presents several typical mathematical problems leading to solutions
	of nonlinear systems. Chapter 2 is devoted to linear algebra problems
	such as eigenvalue problems, matrix norms, invertibility of linear
	operators in $\bbfR^n$, partial order relations. Chapter 3 includes
	$n$-dimensional calculus, G\^ateaux and Fr\'echet derivatives, convex
	functionals and their properties. \par Part II (Chapters 4 to 6)
	presents various existence and uniqueness theorems with nonconstructive
	proofs. Chapter 4 studies gradient operators, rising from minimization
	problems as well as convex functionals. In Chapter 5, contraction
	mapping theorems for inverse and implicit function are proved and
	continuations of local homeomorphisms to global ones are considered.
	Chapter 6 is devoted to the theory of the degree of a mapping, which
	allows simple proofs of known fixed point theorems and is used to
	study monotone and coercive mappings. \par Part III (Chapters 7 and
	8) describes the most common iterative methods for solving systems
	of nonlinear equations. In Chapter 7, the Newton's method, the secant
	and Steffensen methods as well as their variations are discussed.
	Iterative methods for linear systems are generalized to and applied
	to nonlinear problems. Continuation methods for the study of existence
	problems of operator equations are also discussed. Chapter 8 is devoted
	to minimization problems, including the gradient and conjugate gradient
	iterations. \par Part IV (Chapters 9 to 11) discusses local convergence
	and convergence order of iterative processes. In Chapter 9 two different
	measures the $Q$- and $R$-factors of the asymptotic rate of convergence
	for sequences and iterative processes are introduced. Chapter 10
	presents results on local convergence and rate of convergence for
	one-step stationary iterations; for the Newton method, for the $m$-step
	Newton-SOR and $m$-step SOR-Newton and some of the minimization methods
	from Chapter 8. Chapter 11 considers multistep iteration methods
	as well as one-step nonstationary iterations to which the techniques
	from previous chapter do not apply. The main examples are secant-type
	methods, modified Newton iterations and variable-step generalized
	linear iterations. Results on point of attraction and rate of convergence
	are derived as well. \par Part V (Chapter 12 to 14) discusses problems
	on about existence of a solution $x^\ast $ to $Fx=0$ in the case
	of convergence of the iterations, about the choice of initial approximations
	for $x^\ast$ and on estimations of the error after stopping the iterations.
	Chapter 12 is devoted to generalizations of contraction mapping theorems,
	approximate contractions and sequences of contractions, nonlinear
	majorants of contractions. The results are applied to Newton's method.
	While Chapter 12 is based on the usage of norms in $\bbfR^n$, in
	Chapter 13 $\bbfR^n$ is considered to be a partially ordered linear
	space and all results show monotonic convergence of the iterates.
	The last Chapter 14 presents minimization methods for real functionals
	in $\bbfR^n$. Considered are gradient and gradient-related methods,
	Newton-type methods, conjugate direction methods, univariate relaxation
	processes. \par The first edition of the book was published in 1970

  author = {Zeidler, Eberhard},
  abstract = {{The second volume (chapters 18-36) of Zeidler's treatise is a broad
	and up-to-date survey of the monotone operator theory, a popular
	and successful research area of nonlinear analysis, over the past
	25 years. In comparison with the German original (1979; Zbl 0426.47032
	and 1981; Zbl 0481.47041) the number of pages of its English augmented
	translation has been increased five times; this compelled the publisher
	to divide the content into two subvolumes, which form a unit. The
	first subvolume, devoted to linear positive (monotone) operators,
	is a competent introduction to Hilbert space methods in PDE theory.
	As a prelude to the subject, Hilbert orthogonality and the Ritz method,
	as well as an elegant functional analytic foundation of quadratic
	variational problems are presented. More attention is paid to the
	Friedrichs extension for unbounded linear operators and its consequences
	for eigenvalue problems and the semigroup approach of evolution problems
	(mild solutions). Completion and smoothing principles and relationships
	between stability, consistency, and convergence in difference methods
	have been added. \par The second part of the first subvolume deals
	with the approximation- solvability of linear operator equations
	and the convergence of the Galerkin method. Hilbert space methods
	are successively implemented to elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic
	problems, whose peculiarities are emphasized. New topics on functional
	and interpolation inequalities, and regularity of generalized solutions
	are developed. Sufficient rules for strongly positive bilinear forms,
	existence of eigenvalues, and the Fredholm alternative are interacted
	to investigate the boundary value problems for elliptic equations.
	Along this perspective, the monotone mappings appear as a natural
	tool, extending Hilbert space methods to nonlinear problems. Moreover,
	monotone operator machinery yields a rigorous justification of the
	Dirichlet principle, based on the fundamental concept of energy.
	\par After a digest of the basic ideas in the theory of monotone
	operators, the second subvolume develops by progressive stages the
	implementation of monotone operators to stationary and nonstationary
	problems. Upon general hypotheses, quasilinear elliptic or nonlinear
	integral Hammerstein equations can be rewritten as functional equations
	involving monotone- like operators. Furthermore, the pseudomonotone
	operator theory unifies compactness and monotonicity arguments. With
	nonlinear Fredholm alternative are now associated noncoercive problems,
	the Ces\`ari method and the Landesman-Lazer principle, a main bifurcation
	theorem, as well as continuation and multiplicity results. The core
	of the second subvolume emphasizes the efficiency of monotonicity
	arguments, nonlinear semigroups and the Galerkin method in the study
	of nonlinear evolution equations. Kato's new results on semibounded
	evolutions, generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, or Amann's look
	at quasilinear parabolic problems regarded as dynamical systems are
	mentioned. A more constituent additional attribute of monotone operators
	is their maximality. Maximal monotone (set-valued) mappings have
	significant properties and applications to variational problems and
	inequalities or to Hammerstein equations. Their structure is based
	on both the Galerkin method and the regularization procedure via
	duality map. Special monotone mapping subclasses with nice features,
	such as angle-bounded and 3-monotone operators, are described. Key
	theorems about pseudomonotone perturbations of maximal monotone mappings
	and basic geometric elements concerning ranges of sums of monotone
	operators are inserted. Recent progress in semilinear wave equations
	and generalized viscosity solutions are interconnected with the Galerkin
	method for second-order evolution equations. Discretization methods,
	inner and external approximation schemes, for nonlinear equations
	are theorized in the last part of the volume. This leads naturally
	to the introduction of A-proper mappings, for which a multivalued
	topological degree is defined. For the convenience of the reader,
	an appendix summarizes the frequently used notion in measure and
	integration theory, discrete Sobolev spaces, functional calculus
	of selfadjoint operators, interpolation theory of function spaces,
	fractional powers of sectorial operators, Hausdorff measure and fractals,
	etc. Besides, many suggestive schematic overviews explain the interrelations
	between fundamental ideas, concepts and results in nonlinear operator
	theory. Since the proposed subject is too ample, the author has often
	chosen an intermediate way between monograph and directory. Each
	chapter closes with complementary problems and references, orienting
	the reader to current research trends. Moreover, a comprehensive
	bibliography of more than 40 pages concludes the book. Like in other
	previously published parts of this five-volume encyclopaedic series
	(Part I: 1986; Zbl 0583.47050; Part III: 1985; Zbl 0583.47051 and
	Part IV: 1988; Zbl 0648.47036), the lecturer enjoys reading the many
	quotations and remarks made by outstanding scientists or writers
	on the topics covered in the various chapters. It should also be
	emphasized that the author's approach goes straight to a numerical
	functional analysis with applications to finite elements methods
	in Sobolev spaces. \par All in all, this book is an excellent readable
	introduction in the prevalent classes of nonlinear operators. A large
	audience of mathematicians and natural scientists will find it a

  abstract = {{The five volumes (100 chapters) of this treatise are devoted to:
	I) Fixed-point theorems, II) Monotone operators, III) Variational
	methods and optimization (see next review), IV-V) Applications in
	mathematical physics, and are the result of the author's wide experience
	as a researcher and educator involved in the solvability of operator
	equations. The first three volumes are a translated extension of
	the German original [(1976; Zbl 0326.47053 and 1980; Zbl 0434.47042)].
	Although the titles of the chapters are changed according to the
	new enlarged content, the succession of the basic topics is almost
	unaltered. That is why, after some general considerations on the
	entire work, we will point out only certain augmented sections which
	we feel to be more significant in contemporary nonlinar analysis.
	As distinct from the lecture note schemes of the German version,
	every chapter in the English translation has a flowing, coherent
	form and contains nice comments, overviews, and perspectives on the
	strategy and implementations of the considered procedures, and is
	concluded with complementary problems. Moreover, at the end of each
	volume there is a comprehensive and up-to- date bibliography. \par
	The work is clearly written and organized so that each chapter can
	be independently approached. The survey of the basic features of
	most topics of nonlinear functional analysis makes Zeidler's treatise,
	more than any other recent books concerning this subject, a deskbook
	for a broad range of researchers as well as a guide for many graduate
	courses. \par The first volume (chapters 1-17) describes what fixed-point
	theory actually means. In the part that deals with general principles
	and applications, more emphasis is placed on iterative methods, generalizations
	of the implicit function theorem, super- and subsolutions, the nonlinear
	Krein-Rutman theorem, multiple solutions, the Ljapunov-Schmidt branching
	equations, the generic and Hopf bifurcation, minimax theorems, Michael's
	selection theorem and differential inclusions, the Bourbaki-Kneser
	theorem. In the context of the degree theory one also studies the
	fixed-point index and eigenvalue principle, Leray's product rule
	and homeomorphisms, continuation principles in the topological bifurcation
	theory.}},
