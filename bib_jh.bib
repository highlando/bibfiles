	of the existence of an optimal control (which is not expected to
	be unique). Finally, we describe a numerical algorithm based on the

@BOOK{AboFIJ03,
  title = {Matrix Riccati equations in control and systems theory},
  publisher = {Birkh\"auser},
  year = {2003},
  author = {Abou-Kandil, Hisham and Freiling, Gerhard and Ionescu, Vlad and Jank,
	Gerhard},
  address = {Basel, Switzerland},
  abstract = {{The book treats differential Riccati equations $$\dot W= M_{21}(t)+
	M_{22}(t) W- WM_{11}(t)- WM_{12}(t) W,\qquad -\infty&lt; t&lt;\infty,$$
	difference Riccati equations $$W(k+1)=- M_{21}- M_{22}W(k)(I- M_{21}W(k))^{-1}
	M_{11},\qquad k= 0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\dots,$$ and the corresponding algebraic
	Riccati equations $$0= M_{21}+ M_{22} W- WM_{11}- WM_{12} W$$ and
	$$W= -M_{21}- M_{22} W(I- M_{21} W)^{-1} M_{11}.$$ Here $M_{ij}$
	are given matrices (variable or constant, as the case may be) of
	suitable sizes. Most of the book is devoted to the differential Riccati
	equations and their algebraic counterparts.\par The interest in Riccati
	equations has become huge, especially in recent decades, and the
	literature on the subject comprises thousands of items, including
	dozens of books. Much of the research in Riccati equations is motivated
	by applications in mathematics, science, and engineering. Several
	areas of applications, including robust control, disturbance attenuation,
	game theory, and stochastic control, are emphasized in the reviewed
	book. From the standpoint of theoretical mathematics, Riccati equations
	represent a relatively well understood, albeit not without its own
	intricacies and subtleties, class of nonlinear equations: They can
	be linearized via the Grassmannian formulation, and exhibit several
	remarkable properties (for example, preservation of the Loewner partial
	order on Hermitian matrices). A key issue regarding Riccati equations
	involves conditions that guarantee existence of global solutions,
	i.e., solutions that do not escape in finite time.\par The reviewed
	book addresses basic properties of Riccati equations, several of
	their applications, and brings the exposition to the state of the
	art of very recent research. The subject matter is restricted to
	matrix equations (thus, leaving out Riccati equations with possibly
	unbounded operator coefficients, which are of primary importance
	in optimal control of systems governed by PDEs), and to mainly theoretical
	issues, thus de-emphasizing numerical methods (although several numerical
	algorithms and examples are presented). Within these restrictions,
	however, the book is a useful, timely, and welcome addition to the
	literature, as it brings for the first time many recent developments
	in a book form, especially on coupled and generalized equations.
	The book will definitely become a standard reference for many aspects
	of the more advanced theory and applications of matrix Riccati equations.\par
	Chapter headings, with brief comments in parentheses, are as follows:
	1. Basic results for linear equations. 2. Hamiltonian matrices and
	algebraic Riccati equations. (The first two chapters contain rather
	standard material which can be found in some form in many sources
	nowadays.) 3. Global aspects of Riccati differential and difference
	equations. (This chapter includes the study of flows on Grassmann
	manifolds and Riccati equations with periodic coefficients.) 4. Hermitian-Riccati
	differential equations. (In particular, a complete proof is presented
	of the theorem stating that the Riccati differential equation is
	essentially the only equation having the Loewner order preserving
	property.) 5. The periodic Riccati equation. (A description of positive
	semidefinite periodic equilibria is included.) 6. Coupled and generalized
	Riccati equations. (This chapter also contains applications to Nash
	and Stackelberg games, stochastic control, and Markovian jump systems.
	In Stackelberg games the players obey a hierarchical structure of
	leaders and followers, in contrast to Nash games.) 7. Symmetric differential
	Riccati equations: an operator based approach. (Here, the ``Riccati
	theory'', i.e., to quote the book, ``connections between stabilizing
	solutions to the symmetric algebraic Riccati equation, invertibility
	of the Toeplitz operator associated with the input-output operator
	of the underlying Hamiltonian system, and existence of antianalytic
	factorization of the Popov function'', is presented in the context
	of time-varying systems and the descriptor operator approach.) 8.
	Applications to robust control systems. (The material here contains
	a thorough treatment of the four-block Nehari and disturbance attenuation
	problems.) 9. Nonsymmetric Riccati theory and applications. (Extension
	of the Riccati theory to the nonsymmetric algebraic Riccati equation
	is developed, with applications in game theory, in particular, open
	loop Nash and Stackelberg equilibria.)\par The up-to-date bibliography
	is quite extensive, containing more than 400 items.}},

@BOOK{Bar93,
  title = {Analysis and control of nonlinear infinite dimensional systems},
  publisher = {Academic Press},
  year = {1993},
  author = {Barbu, Viorel},
  address = {Boston},
  abstract = {{The optimal control problems studied in this book are governed by
	state equations of the form $Ay=Bu+f$ and $y'+Ay=Bu+f$, where $A$
	is a nonlinear accretive (multivalued) operator in a Banach space
	$X$, $B$ is a linear continuous operator from a controller space
	$U$ to $X$, and $u$ is the control parameter. The cost functional
	is in general not differentiable, and since the state equation is
	nonlinear this leads to a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem.
	The book is written in a dual perspective, analysis-synthesis taking
	into account that in contemporary mathematics control theory is complementarily
	related to the analysis of differential systems.\par The first chapter
	contains preliminaries, and the second one deals with nonlinear operators
	of monotone type. Chapter 3 is concerned with optimal control problems
	governed by variational inequalities of elliptic type and semilinear
	elliptic equations. The main emphasis is put on first order necessary
	conditions of optimality obtained by an approximating regularizing
	process. The general theory is applied to controlled free boundary
	problems such as the obstacle problem and the Signorini problem.
	Chapter 4 is devoted to the Cauchy problem associated with nonlinear
	accretive operators in Banach space. The main result is related to
	the Crandall-Liggett exponential formula for autonomous equations.
	Applications are given to nonlinear parabolic equations and variational
	inequalities, first order quasilinear equations, the nonlinear diffusion
	equations, and nonlinear hyperbolic equations. Optimal control problems
	governed by semilinear parabolic equations and by parabolic variational
	inequalities are considered in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 is concerned
	with the feedback representation of optimal controllers to problems

	a combination of this method with a variant of Newton's method (in

	for the solution of large-scale Riccati equations. Third, we describe
	an implicit version of this algorithm for the solution of linear-quadratic
	optimal control problems, which computes the feedback directly without
	solving the underlying algebraic Riccati equation explicitly. Our
	algorithms are efficient with respect to both memory and computation.

@BOOK{Bre11,
  title = {{Functional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces and Partial Differential Equations}},
  publisher = {Springer},
  year = {2011},
  author = {Brezis, Haim},
  address = {New York, NY},
  abstract = {{Functional analysis evolved as the natural gathering point for a
	number of different investigations into the solvability of many classes
	of problems, including differential or partial differential equations
	or linear equations which are either in the form of integral equations
	or in the form of countable systems of linear scalar equations in
	which the unknown is a sequence of numbers. As the subject developed,
	much broader areas of applicability became evident. These applications,
	in turn, spawned further abstract development, and the abstract results
	themselves assumed an intrinsic interest. A previous version of this
	book, originally published in 1983 in French [{\it H. Brezis}, ``Analyse
	fonctionnelle. Th\'eorie et applications'' (Collection Math\'ematiques
	Appliqu\'ees pour la Ma\^{\i}trise; Paris: Masson) (1983; Zbl 0511.46001)]
	and followed by numerous translations, became very popular worldwide,
	and was adopted as a textbook in many European universities. A deficiency
	of the French text was the lack of exercises. The present volume
	contains a wealth of problems. The author's aim is to give a systematic
	treatment of some of the fundamental abstract results in functional
	analysis and of their applications to certain concrete problems in
	linear differential and partial differential equations. Moreover,
	by interlacing extensive commentary and foreshadowing subsequent
	developments within the formal scheme of statements and proofs, by
	the inclusion of many apt examples and by appending interesting and
	challenging exercises, the author has written a book which is eminently
	suitable as a text for a graduate course. This volume is distinguished
	by the broad variety of problems which have been treated and by the
	abstract results which are developed. The content of the book is
	divided into 11 chapters, as follows: I. The Hahn-Banach theorems.
	Introduction to the theory of conjugate convex functions; II. The
	Banach-Steinhaus and closed graph theorems. Orthogonality relations.
	Unbounded operators. The notion of adjoint. Characterization of surjective
	operators; III. Weak topologies. Reflexive spaces. Separable spaces.
	Uniformly convex spaces; IV. $L^p$-spaces; V. Hilbert spaces; VI.
	Compact operators. Spectral decomposition of compact selfadjoint
	operators; VII. The Hille-Yosida theorem; VIII. Sobolev spaces and
	variational formulation of boundary value problems in dimension one;
	IX. Sobolev spaces and variational formulation of boundary value
	problems in dimension $N$; X. Evolution problems: the heat equation
	and the wave equation; XI. Miscellaneous Complements. Following Chapter
	XI, there are solutions for selected exercises (a significant number
	of complete solutions for the exercises following each chapter are
	included). Next, a list of 51 problems follows. These are mostly
	theorems, or otherwise theoretical results, the proofs of which could
	be treated separately from the main text. Finally, there is a section
	of hints and partial solutions for the set of 51 problems. In summary,
	this book is a tour-de-force by the author, who is a master of modern
	nonlinear functional analysis and who has contributed extensively
	to the development of the theory of partial differential equations.
	The volume under review deals rigorously with mathematical models
	of a certain applicability to the real world. From this viewpoint,
	it is a significant contribution to a currently active area of research.
	Globally, the reviewer very much likes the spirit and the scope of
	the book. The writing is lively, the material is diverse and maintains
	a strong unity. The interplay between the abstract functional analysis
	and relevant concrete problems arising in applications is emphasized
	throughout. On balance, the book is a very useful contribution to
	the growing literature on this circle of ideas. I wholeheartedly
	recommend this book both as a textbook, and for independent study.}},

	$N: R\sp n\times R\sp m\mapsto R\sp m$. The method involves applying
	the basic iteration S of a general solver for the equation $G(u,t)=0$,
	with t fixed. It is therefore well suited for problems for which
	such a solver already exists or can be implemented more efficiently
	than a solver for the coupled system. We derive conditions for S
	under which the method is locally convergent. Basically, if S is
	sufficiently contractive for G, then convergence for the coupled
	system is guaranteed. Otherwise, we show how to construct an $\hat
	S$ from S for which convergence is assured. These results are applied
	to continuation methods where N represents a pseudo-arclength condition.
	We show that under certain conditions the algorithm converges if

@BOOK{Deu04,

	Algorithms}},
  publisher = {{Springer Series in Computational Mathematics 35. Berlin: Springer}},
  year = {2004},
  author = {Deuflhard, Peter},
  abstract = {{Although the invariance of Newton's method under affine transformations
	tends to be known, it has scarcely been taken into account in standard
	convergence theories and typical computational practice. For many
	years the author and various colleagues have shown that careful attention
	to this affine invariance allows for the development of highly effective
	algorithms. This book represents a long awaited comprehensive treatise
	of these important, and, by now, wide ranging results. It reflects
	the author's conviction (shared by this reviewer) that mathematical
	theory and algorithm construction should mutually influence each
	other as closely as possible. Accordingly, the presentation is strongly
	balanced in its interplay between the theoretical analysis and the
	development of algorithms that are effective for realistic, and not
	just toy-type, problems. \par The overall presentation has two basic
	threads. The first involves close consideration of four affine invariances
	for Newton's method applied to a nonlinear mapping $F$ between Banach
	spaces: (1) Affine covariance: The iterates are invariant under affine
	transformations of the image space. (2) Affine contravariance: Under
	affine transformations of the domain space the iterates transform
	in the same way. (3) Affine conjugacy: If $F$ is a gradient mapping
	then under an affine transformation of the domain space the Jacobian
	transformation is conjugate. (4) Affine similarity: In the case of
	identical domain and image spaces an affine transformation induces
	a similarity transformation of the Jacobian. \par The second thread
	is a computational paradigm central to the construction of adaptive
	Newton algorithms: Affine-invariant computational estimates of affine
	invariant Lipschitz constants are cheaply available in the course
	of the algorithms, while, without strict observation of the affine
	invariance of the Lipschitz conditions geometric distortions lead
	to totally unrealistic estimates. \par After an introductory chapter
	covering the basic background and terminology, the book is divided
	into two parts. The first part concerns Newton methods in finite
	dimensions. Different affine invariant Lipschitz conditions lead
	to different local convergence domains in terms of different norms.
	In particular, the above named invariances (1), (2), and (3) give
	rise to algorithms that are controlled by error norms, residual norms,
	and energy norms, respectively. The details are worked out for different
	types of Newton algorithms and then globalization concepts are surveyed,
	such as steepest descent methods, trust region methods, Levenberg
	Marquardt methods, and Newton's method with damping strategies. Affine
	invariance also plays an important role in local and global Gauss-Newton
	methods for nonlinear least squares. In addition, adaptive continuation
	processes for parameter dependent nonlinear equations are discussed
	and attention is also directed to augmented systems for determining
	selected critical points. \par The second part of the book turns
	to infinite-dimensional problems. For stiff initial value problems
	for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) a simplified Newton method
	is analyzed as a replacement of the standard Picard iteration that,
	typically, is suitable only for nonstiff problems. For nonlinear
	two-point ODE boundary value problems an adaptive multilevel collocation
	method is applied and analyzed as an inexact Newton method in function
	space. Finally, the last chapter addresses asymptotic mesh independence
	and the use of inexact Newton multilevel finite element methods for
	solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDE) boundary value
	problems. \par Throughout the text algorithms are presented as informal
	programs. Many of these have been implemented in detail and were
	used for various numerical examples. Web sites for these codes are
	provided. \par In many parts the presentation covers unpublished
	material and also points to possible future research areas and relevant
	topics that have not been included. As such the book is certainly
	a research monograph. However, the form of the presentation also
	makes selected parts well accessible for use as text material in
	appropriate courses. All in all, this is an excellent contribution
	to the computational analysis of nonlinear equations that should
	be of interest to anyone interested in this area.}},

  abstract = {{Publisher's description: For more than forty years, the equation
	$y'(t) = Ay(t) + u(t)$ in Banach spaces has been used as model for
	optimal control processes described by partial differential equations,
	in particular heat and diffusion processes. Many of the outstanding
	open problems, however, have remained open until recently, and some
	have never been solved. This book is a survey of all results know
	to the author, with emphasis on very recent results (1999 to date).
	The book is restricted to linear equations and two particular problems
	(the time optimal problem, the norm optimal problem) which results
	in a more focused and concrete treatment. As experience shows, results
	on linear equations are the basis for the treatment of their semilinear
	counterparts, and techniques for the time and norm optimal problems
	can often be generalized to more general cost functionals. The main
	object of this book is to be a state-of-the-art monograph on the
	theory of the time and norm optimal controls for $y'(t) = Ay(t) +
	u(t)$ that ends at the very latest frontier of research, with open

  publisher = {Springer},
  year = {1989},
  author = {Hairer, Ernst and Lubich, Christian and Roche, Michel},
  address = {Berlin, Germany},
  abstract = {{In this monograph the authors systematically study application of
	implicit and semi-explicit Runge-Kutta methods for discrete approximation
	to differential-algebraic systems of ordinary differential equations.
	Applications to singularly perturbed systems are also included. The
	systems are classified according to the permutation index of the
	system, i.e. the behavior of the residual under a small perturbation
	of the solution. \par It is shown that the appropriate choice of
	the Runge-Kutta method depends directly on the index of the system.
	Explicit choices are discussed for indices $m=1,2,3$ (systems in
	normal form have index $m=0)$. Numerical results are presented for
	a number of interesting applications. A new code RADAU 5 in Fortran
	is presented for a 3-stage Radau IIA Runge-Kutta method which is
	applicable for indices $m=1,2,3.$ \par Given a system of differential
	equations in implicit form $F(Y',Y)=0$ the equation has perturbation
	index m along a solution Y on [0,b] if for all Z near Y the defect
	$\delta (x)=F(Z',Z)$ satisfies $$ \Vert Z(x)- Y(x)\Vert \le C(\Vert
	Z(0)-Y(0)\Vert +\sum\sp{m-1}\sb{j=0}\max\sb{0\le t\le x}\Vert \delta\sp{(j)}(t)\Vert).
	$$ The authors employ the following canonical forms for systems with
	indices $m=1,2,3:$ 1) $m=1$, $y'=f(y,z),\quad g(y,z)=0$ and $g\sb
	z$ is invertible. 2) $m=2$, $y'=f(y,z),\quad g(y)=0,$ and $g\sb yf\sb
	z$ has a bounded inverse. 3) $m=3$, $y'=f(y,z),\quad z'=k(y,z,u),\quad
	0=g(y,u)$ and $g\sb yf\sb zk\sb u$ has a bounded inverse. Which Runge-Kutta
	algorithm may be applied to a system depends on which of these forms
	it assumes. The applicable implicit Runge-Kutta methods are classified
	following {\it J. C. Butcher} [The numerical analysis of ordinary
	differential equations (1987; Zbl 0616.65072)] and {\it K. Dekker}
	and {\it J. G. Verwer} [Stability of Runge-Kutta methods for stiff
	nonlinear differential equations (1984; Zbl 0571.65057)] according
	to whether Gauss, Radau, or Lobatto quadrature is used. The specific
	algorithms considered are Gauss, Radau IA, IIA, and Lobatto IIIA,
	IIIC. In addition singly diagonal methods of {\it R. Alexander} [SIAM
	J. Numer. Anal. 14, 1006-1021 (1977; Zbl 0374.65038)] and of {\it
	S. P. N{\o}rsett} and {\it P. Thomsen} [BIT 26, 100-113 (1986; Zbl
	0627.65082)] are covered. \par The notion of perturbation index and
	the classification of differential- algebraic systems is presented
	in chapter 1. Chapter 2 contains a review of Runge-Kutta methods
	for ordinary differential and differential- algebraic equations including
	methods for singularly perturbed systems. Chapters 3-6 select and
	describe methods appropriate respectively for indices $m=1,2,3$.
	Proofs of convergence of the methods are presented including convergence
	for associated perturbed systems. Chapter 7 presents a simplified
	Newton method applicable to the relevant algorithms and chapter 8
	concerns local error estimation. In chapter 9 a summary of numerical
	results is given for a number of interesting applications and chapter
	10 presents the code RADAU 5. \par The material presented in the
	monograph represents recent research by many authors which is published
	here for the first time in a unified form. A comprehensive bibliography
	and index are included.}},

	method is proposed for efficiently solving the QPs. The convergence

	relies on the concept of slant differentiability for proving locally
	superlinear convergence of the QP-solver. For the analysis of the
	outer SQP-iteration a generalized equations approach is utilized.
	Sufficient conditions for guaranteeing strong regularity of the generalized
	equation are established which, in turn, allows one to argue a quadratic
	rate of convergence of the SQP-method. The paper ends with a report

  abstract = {{The book presents a state-of-the-art of optimization problems described
	by partial differential equations (PDEs) and algorithms for obtaining
	their solutions. Solving optimization problems with constraints given
	in terms of PDEs is one of the most challenging problems appearing,
	e.g., in industry, medical and economical applications. The book
	consists of four chapters. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to
	analytical background and optimality theory for optimization problems
	with PDEs. First, necessary background in functional analysis, Sobolev
	spaces, the theory of week solutions for elliptic and parabolic equations
	and G{\'a}teaux and Fr{\'e}chet differentiability are presented.
	Next, existence of optimal controls both for linear quadratic and
	nonlinear abstract problems in Hilbert spaces are considered. Further,
	first order optimality conditions for problems described by PDEs
	with control and state constraints are derived. Elliptic, parabolic
	and Navier-Stokes optimal control problems are used as illustrative
	examples. The second chapter presents a selection of important algorithms
	for optimization problems with PDEs. Several variants of generalized
	Newton methods in Banach spaces are derived and analysed. Problems
	of convergence of the considered algorithms are discussed in details.
	Elliptic and Navier-Stokes optimal control problems are used as illustrative
	examples. The third chapter gives an introduction to discrete concepts
	for optimization problems with PDEs constraints. Two approaches:
	``First discretize, then optimize'' and ``First optimize, then discretize''
	are compared and discussed. Several numerical examples together with
	error analysis are presented. The final fourth chapter is devoted
	to the study of two industrial applications in which optimization
	with PDEs plays a crucial role. Two problems from modern semiconductor
	design and glass industry are described in details together with
	their numerical studies of related optimal control problems. Every
	chapter of the book was written by another author. In spite of this,
	four chapters of the book are logically and smoothly connected. Notations
	and terminology used throughout the book are consequent. This well-written
	book can be recommended to scientists and graduate students working
	in the fields of optimal control theory, optimization algorithms
	and numerical solving of optimization problems described by PDEs.}},

	vectors, tensors, and conservation laws, which is necessary to go
	farther in CFD. Part II opens with Chapter 4, which presents mixed
	methods for Stokes problem. A derivation of NSE and the properties
	of solutions that are essential to understand their numerical features
	are the topics of Chapter 5. The theory of steady NSE and their numerical
	analysis are the aim of Chapter 6 and 7, respectively. Part III considers
	time-dependent fluid flows beginning with a summary of the Leray
	theory for NSE in Chapter 8. Chapter 8 proves also stability of finite
	element methods for time-dependent NSE, backing upon the energy equality.
	The final topic mentions the enormous variety of fluid flow phenomena
	from the turbulence. But the author restricts himself to the presentation
	of homogeneous isotropic turbulence (Chapter 10). Each chapter on
	the theory is followed by a chapter on numerical analysis that expands
	the theory. The chapters contain numerous exercises. With mathematical
	rigor and physical clarity, this book provides a useful tool for
	understanding the foundations of methods commonly used for flow simulations.}},

  abstract = {{The book provides an excellent survey of theoretical results on finite-dimensional
	functional analysis. The Newton method for solving nonlinear systems
	surves as a basis where a variety of its modifications is presented,
	problems related to local and global convergence are studied, iterative
	methods for numerical solutions are considered. \par The book includes
	five parts, subdivided in fourteen chapters, a bibliography involving
	about 850 papers and books, an Index and a Glossary of symbols. Each
	chapter is subdivided in sections, most of which are supplemented
	with ``Notes and Remarks'' giving some additional results to the
	problems discussed as well as a specified list of references. There
	are also exercises included which make the book very useful for graduate
	students and others working in this field. \par Part I (Chapters
	1 to 3) has an introductory character. It collects background material
	from analysis and linear algebra used in following parts. Chapter
	1 presents several typical mathematical problems leading to solutions
	of nonlinear systems. Chapter 2 is devoted to linear algebra problems
	such as eigenvalue problems, matrix norms, invertibility of linear
	operators in $\bbfR^n$, partial order relations. Chapter 3 includes
	$n$-dimensional calculus, G\^ateaux and Fr\'echet derivatives, convex
	functionals and their properties. \par Part II (Chapters 4 to 6)
	presents various existence and uniqueness theorems with nonconstructive
	proofs. Chapter 4 studies gradient operators, rising from minimization
	problems as well as convex functionals. In Chapter 5, contraction
	mapping theorems for inverse and implicit function are proved and
	continuations of local homeomorphisms to global ones are considered.
	Chapter 6 is devoted to the theory of the degree of a mapping, which
	allows simple proofs of known fixed point theorems and is used to
	study monotone and coercive mappings. \par Part III (Chapters 7 and
	8) describes the most common iterative methods for solving systems
	of nonlinear equations. In Chapter 7, the Newton's method, the secant
	and Steffensen methods as well as their variations are discussed.
	Iterative methods for linear systems are generalized to and applied
	to nonlinear problems. Continuation methods for the study of existence
	problems of operator equations are also discussed. Chapter 8 is devoted
	to minimization problems, including the gradient and conjugate gradient
	iterations. \par Part IV (Chapters 9 to 11) discusses local convergence
	and convergence order of iterative processes. In Chapter 9 two different
	measures the $Q$- and $R$-factors of the asymptotic rate of convergence
	for sequences and iterative processes are introduced. Chapter 10
	presents results on local convergence and rate of convergence for
	one-step stationary iterations; for the Newton method, for the $m$-step
	Newton-SOR and $m$-step SOR-Newton and some of the minimization methods
	from Chapter 8. Chapter 11 considers multistep iteration methods
	as well as one-step nonstationary iterations to which the techniques
	from previous chapter do not apply. The main examples are secant-type
	methods, modified Newton iterations and variable-step generalized
	linear iterations. Results on point of attraction and rate of convergence
	are derived as well. \par Part V (Chapter 12 to 14) discusses problems
	on about existence of a solution $x^\ast $ to $Fx=0$ in the case
	of convergence of the iterations, about the choice of initial approximations
	for $x^\ast$ and on estimations of the error after stopping the iterations.
	Chapter 12 is devoted to generalizations of contraction mapping theorems,
	approximate contractions and sequences of contractions, nonlinear
	majorants of contractions. The results are applied to Newton's method.
	While Chapter 12 is based on the usage of norms in $\bbfR^n$, in
	Chapter 13 $\bbfR^n$ is considered to be a partially ordered linear
	space and all results show monotonic convergence of the iterates.
	The last Chapter 14 presents minimization methods for real functionals
	in $\bbfR^n$. Considered are gradient and gradient-related methods,
	Newton-type methods, conjugate direction methods, univariate relaxation
	processes. \par The first edition of the book was published in 1970
	(see Zbl 0241.65046). The present new edition is equipped with a
	Preface, where the authors indicate ``some of the principle developments
	and changes'' and give some recent books and papers related to topics
	considered.}},

  abstract = {{This second edition (for a review of the first edition (1990), see
	Zbl 0703.93001) contains the following new items: \par 1) A chapter
	on nonlinear controllability on $R^p$ (the adopted language is not
	suitable for manifolds). Controllable and reachable sets to and from
	$x_0$ respectively have nonempty interior if a Lie algebra arising
	from vector fields defining the control system can be identified
	with $R^p$ at $x_0$. If in addition a defined reversibility condition
	holds, then $x_0$ belongs to the interior of the intersection of
	these two sets. Moreover, a criterion for complete controllability
	is obtained in this context. After devoting several pages to introduce
	and prove the Frobenius theorem, a converse to the first implication
	from above is provided when the conditions hold on possibly distinct
	open dense subsets of the state space. In the reviewer's opinion,
	it is unfortunate that the concept of strong accessibility and related
	criteria are not treated: it is an important situation in the gap
	between accessibility and controllability which provides deeper insight
	into what is going on. This information can be found in the book
	of {\it H. Nijmeijer} and {\it A. van der Schaft} [Nonlinear dynamical
	control systems (1990; Zbl 0701.93001)]. \par 2) A chapter is devoted
	to optimal control with constrained and unconstrained controls. The
	author obtains the extremum principle of Pontryagin and the Euler-Lagrange
	equation of the calculus of variations in a separate section. Another
	section deals with gradient-based numerical methods. \par 3) The
	minimum-time problem for linear systems is presented in a new chapter.
	The assumption is that the control set is convex and compact. The
	author shows that the reachability set in any time from any point
	is compact and convex through suitably defined weakly convergent
	sequences of control policies. Existence of an optimal control follows
	from the fact that the introduced reachability set is closed. The
	convexity of the reachability set is used to characterize final time
	optimal states on its boundary. This last situation is equivalent
	to an extremum principle and if an additional controllability type
	condition holds, the converse is true i.e. time-optimality is obtained
	from the boundary condition or the extremality principle. \par 4)
	A new section presents single input feedback linearization and nonlinear
	optimal stabilization is treated p. 390 via the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
	whose solution yields a value function for an optimization problem.
	This value function is a Lyapunov function. But this way of handling
	the problem is subject to plugging the right feedback in the Hamilton-Jacobi
	equation which will lead to a solution. Nonlinear stabilization is
	also introduced p. 239 where control Lyapunov functions and backstepping
	are presented. \par 5) Two sections deal with controllability in
	recurrent neural nets and controllability of linear systems with
	bounded controls. In the first case, the system is modelled by $$\dot
	x= \theta_n (Ax+Bu)$$ where $x\in R^n$ and $\theta_n$ is a diagonal
	mapping having each of its components acting as a saturation function
	modelled by the hyperbolic tangent. The main result is that local
	strong controllability around any state is equivalent to the condition
	that the rows of $B$ do not vanish nor do two rows coincide or are
	opposite. The result is obtained from a lemma interesting in its
	own sake: For the system $\dot x= f(x,u)$, if there is $x_0$ such
	that the origin belongs to the interior of the convex hull of the
	set of vectors $f(x_0,u)$ for $u$ in its admissible set, then there
	is a neighborhood of $x_0$ which is controllable to $x_0$ and reachable
	from $x_0$. The proof uses the analytic and asymptotic properties
	of the tangent hyperbolic function and is not trivial. In the case
	of bounded controls, it is shown that any point of the state space
	can be reached if and only if the system is controllable with an
	unstable drift. \par 6) The chapter on dynamic programming and $L-Q$
	problems has been revised. \par 7) ``Errors and typos have been corrected''
	(but there are some left) and a list of symbols has been added. \par
	This new edition gets closer to the impossible task of presenting
	a complete and rigorous panorama of control theory in a single book.
	It is one of the best source available with respect to these two
	qualities.}},

  address = {New York, NY},
  abstract = {{The central theme of this book is functional analytic treatment of
	the Navier-Stokes equations with particular focusing on issues in
	connection with mathematical models used in Oceanography. The book
	is an adapted and slightly enlarged and revised version of lecture
	notes from a graduate course that the author held at Carnegie Mellon
	University in 1999, initially under the title ``Partial Differential
	Equations Models in Oceanography". The author's mathematical approach
	to the subject reflects the spirit of the pioneering works of Jean
	Leray and Olga Ladyzhenskaya, the two famous mathematicians in this
	field who the author had known personally and to whom too he dedicates
	his book in their memory and in admiration of their achievements.
	\par The book consists of 44 lectures, completed with preface, introduction,
	detailed description of the lectures, bibliographical information,
	abbreviations and mathematical notation, references, and index. The
	author describes the general techniques for nonlinear partial differential
	equations that the he had developed, comprising, among others, the
	useful topics {\it homogenization}, {\it compensated compactness}
	and {\it H-measures}. Five lectures are explicitly devoted to or
	contain material connected with Sobolev spaces and the Sobolev embedding
	theorem. Explicitly stated theorems and lemmas are provided with
	proofs. \par The book reads as a scientific autobiography of the
	writer. It is written in a vivid (sometimes a little too argumentative,
	sometimes seeming a little boasting) first-person writing style,
	not only in the preface but also throughout all the chapters of the
	book. Though writing scientific literature in the first-person writing
	style is a controversial and nowadays often disputed question, this
	book is, in the reviewer's opinion, a very good exposition of the
	topic it is dealing with. \par Another attractive feature of this
	book is the inclusion of short biographical data (given in footnotes)
	for all persons quoted in the text. Those of them, who the author
	had met or had/has collaborated with, are mentioned with their first
	names in the text, and it is impressive seeing how many they have
	been. (A note: One of them has been Robert Dautray (mentioned on
	page XIII), but his name has not been included (presumably accidently)
	into the list under ``Biographical Information" at the end of the
	book.) \par The course had been intended for mathematicians in the
	first place, in the present book form, however, it will be a welcome
	reading, in its larger part, also for hydrodynamicists and other
	researchers in the field with less specialization in functional analysis.}},

  address = {Berlin, Germany},
  abstract = {{This book, mainly directed to professional CFD specialists, presents
	recent numerical and algorithmic tools for the solution of incompressible
	Navier-Stokes equations on modern computer platforms. The main feature
	of the book is a detailed description of the solution process for
	resulting large discrete systems of equations which is often neglected
	in the literature. The presentation covers a large amount of information,
	reflecting the scientific interests of the author and his colleagues
	from the FEAST fluid dynamics research group, Heidelberg University.\par
	The book consists of six chapters. A short introductory chapter 1
	``Motivation for current research" describes some recent results
	from a benchmark configuration (two- and three-dimensional flows
	around a cylinder). These results are critically discussed from the
	numerical and algorithmic points of view. Chapter 2 ``Derivation
	of Navier-Stokes solvers'' presents a large class of solvers based
	on local and global multilevel pressure Schur complements. The aim
	is to split strictly the tasks, namely to outline the outer control
	part responsible for the global convergence and accuracy, and the
	inner solver part which provides approximate solutions in a given
	discrete framework.\par Some modern discretization techniques and
	solution of discrete systems of equations are topics of the central
	chapter 3 modestly called ``Other mathematical components''. Here
	the author examines some finite element spaces, time stepping methods,
	boundary conditions, and finally gives a detailed treatment of nonlinear
	iterative and linear multigrid methods for discrete systems of equations.
	Chapter 4 ``Numerical comparison of Navier-Stokes solvers" uses exemplary
	numerical examples (nonsteady flow around a cylinder, stationary
	channel flow around a square, nonstationary flow through a Venturi
	pipe) to compare the merits and shortcomings of the solvers presented.
	This comparison is continued in the summarizing chapter 5 ``Conclusions
	and outlook''.\par The last chapter ``The enclosed CD-ROM" gives
	a brief description of the software added to the book. These include
	the complete FEATFLOW 1.1 package (tested on UNIX/LINUX platform,
	Fortran77 compiler required), and the ``Virtual Album of Fluid Motion''
	running also under Windows 9x, with a lot of impressive colour MPEG-format
	videos which enable the interested reader to perform his own simulations.\par
	On balance, the book is well organized, clearly and rigorously written,
	and can be very useful to the readers who are properly experienced

	problems modeled after melt crystal growth processes. These problems
	are represented by partitioned spatial regions, each modeled by independent
	heat transfer codes and linked by temperature and flux matching conditions
	at the boundaries common to the partitions. Whereas a typical block
	Gauss-Seidel iteration fails about half the time for the model problem,
	quadratic convergence is achieved by the ABN method under all conditions
	studied here. Additional performance advantages over existing methods
	are demonstrated and discussed.},

@BOOK{Zei90,
  title = {{Nonlinear functional analysis and its applications. II/B: Nonlinear
	monotone operators}},
  publisher = {Springer},
  year = {1990},
  author = {Zeidler, Eberhard},
  address = {Berlin, Germany},
  abstract = {{The second volume (chapters 18-36) of Zeidler's treatise is a broad
	and up-to-date survey of the monotone operator theory, a popular
	and successful research area of nonlinear analysis, over the past
	25 years. In comparison with the German original (1979; Zbl 0426.47032
	and 1981; Zbl 0481.47041) the number of pages of its English augmented
	translation has been increased five times; this compelled the publisher
	to divide the content into two subvolumes, which form a unit. The
	first subvolume, devoted to linear positive (monotone) operators,
	is a competent introduction to Hilbert space methods in PDE theory.
	As a prelude to the subject, Hilbert orthogonality and the Ritz method,
	as well as an elegant functional analytic foundation of quadratic
	variational problems are presented. More attention is paid to the
	Friedrichs extension for unbounded linear operators and its consequences
	for eigenvalue problems and the semigroup approach of evolution problems
	(mild solutions). Completion and smoothing principles and relationships
	between stability, consistency, and convergence in difference methods
	have been added. \par The second part of the first subvolume deals
	with the approximation- solvability of linear operator equations
	and the convergence of the Galerkin method. Hilbert space methods
	are successively implemented to elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic
	problems, whose peculiarities are emphasized. New topics on functional
	and interpolation inequalities, and regularity of generalized solutions
	are developed. Sufficient rules for strongly positive bilinear forms,
	existence of eigenvalues, and the Fredholm alternative are interacted
	to investigate the boundary value problems for elliptic equations.
	Along this perspective, the monotone mappings appear as a natural
	tool, extending Hilbert space methods to nonlinear problems. Moreover,
	monotone operator machinery yields a rigorous justification of the
	Dirichlet principle, based on the fundamental concept of energy.
	\par After a digest of the basic ideas in the theory of monotone
	operators, the second subvolume develops by progressive stages the
	implementation of monotone operators to stationary and nonstationary
	problems. Upon general hypotheses, quasilinear elliptic or nonlinear
	integral Hammerstein equations can be rewritten as functional equations
	involving monotone- like operators. Furthermore, the pseudomonotone
	operator theory unifies compactness and monotonicity arguments. With
	nonlinear Fredholm alternative are now associated noncoercive problems,
	the Ces\`ari method and the Landesman-Lazer principle, a main bifurcation
	theorem, as well as continuation and multiplicity results. The core
	of the second subvolume emphasizes the efficiency of monotonicity
	arguments, nonlinear semigroups and the Galerkin method in the study
	of nonlinear evolution equations. Kato's new results on semibounded
	evolutions, generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, or Amann's look
	at quasilinear parabolic problems regarded as dynamical systems are
	mentioned. A more constituent additional attribute of monotone operators
	is their maximality. Maximal monotone (set-valued) mappings have
	significant properties and applications to variational problems and
	inequalities or to Hammerstein equations. Their structure is based
	on both the Galerkin method and the regularization procedure via
	duality map. Special monotone mapping subclasses with nice features,
	such as angle-bounded and 3-monotone operators, are described. Key
	theorems about pseudomonotone perturbations of maximal monotone mappings
	and basic geometric elements concerning ranges of sums of monotone
	operators are inserted. Recent progress in semilinear wave equations
	and generalized viscosity solutions are interconnected with the Galerkin
	method for second-order evolution equations. Discretization methods,
	inner and external approximation schemes, for nonlinear equations
	are theorized in the last part of the volume. This leads naturally
	to the introduction of A-proper mappings, for which a multivalued
	topological degree is defined. For the convenience of the reader,
	an appendix summarizes the frequently used notion in measure and
	integration theory, discrete Sobolev spaces, functional calculus
	of selfadjoint operators, interpolation theory of function spaces,
	fractional powers of sectorial operators, Hausdorff measure and fractals,
	etc. Besides, many suggestive schematic overviews explain the interrelations
	between fundamental ideas, concepts and results in nonlinear operator
	theory. Since the proposed subject is too ample, the author has often
	chosen an intermediate way between monograph and directory. Each
	chapter closes with complementary problems and references, orienting
	the reader to current research trends. Moreover, a comprehensive
	bibliography of more than 40 pages concludes the book. Like in other
	previously published parts of this five-volume encyclopaedic series
	(Part I: 1986; Zbl 0583.47050; Part III: 1985; Zbl 0583.47051 and
	Part IV: 1988; Zbl 0648.47036), the lecturer enjoys reading the many
	quotations and remarks made by outstanding scientists or writers
	on the topics covered in the various chapters. It should also be
	emphasized that the author's approach goes straight to a numerical
	functional analysis with applications to finite elements methods
	in Sobolev spaces. \par All in all, this book is an excellent readable
	introduction in the prevalent classes of nonlinear operators. A large
	audience of mathematicians and natural scientists will find it a
	stimulating guide through the contemporary operator treatment of
	nonlinear partial differential and integral equations.}},

  abstract = {{The five volumes (100 chapters) of this treatise are devoted to:
	I) Fixed-point theorems, II) Monotone operators, III) Variational
	methods and optimization (see next review), IV-V) Applications in
	mathematical physics, and are the result of the author's wide experience
	as a researcher and educator involved in the solvability of operator
	equations. The first three volumes are a translated extension of
	the German original [(1976; Zbl 0326.47053 and 1980; Zbl 0434.47042)].
	Although the titles of the chapters are changed according to the
	new enlarged content, the succession of the basic topics is almost
	unaltered. That is why, after some general considerations on the
	entire work, we will point out only certain augmented sections which
	we feel to be more significant in contemporary nonlinar analysis.
	As distinct from the lecture note schemes of the German version,
	every chapter in the English translation has a flowing, coherent
	form and contains nice comments, overviews, and perspectives on the
	strategy and implementations of the considered procedures, and is
	concluded with complementary problems. Moreover, at the end of each
	volume there is a comprehensive and up-to- date bibliography. \par
	The work is clearly written and organized so that each chapter can
	be independently approached. The survey of the basic features of
	most topics of nonlinear functional analysis makes Zeidler's treatise,
	more than any other recent books concerning this subject, a deskbook
	for a broad range of researchers as well as a guide for many graduate
	courses. \par The first volume (chapters 1-17) describes what fixed-point
	theory actually means. In the part that deals with general principles
	and applications, more emphasis is placed on iterative methods, generalizations
	of the implicit function theorem, super- and subsolutions, the nonlinear
	Krein-Rutman theorem, multiple solutions, the Ljapunov-Schmidt branching
	equations, the generic and Hopf bifurcation, minimax theorems, Michael's
	selection theorem and differential inclusions, the Bourbaki-Kneser
	theorem. In the context of the degree theory one also studies the
	fixed-point index and eigenvalue principle, Leray's product rule
	and homeomorphisms, continuation principles in the topological bifurcation
	theory.}},
