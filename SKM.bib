  abstract = {{The book treats differential Riccati equations $$\dot W= M_{21}(t)+
	M_{22}(t) W- WM_{11}(t)- WM_{12}(t) W,\qquad -\infty&lt; t&lt;\infty,$$
	difference Riccati equations $$W(k+1)=- M_{21}- M_{22}W(k)(I- M_{21}W(k))^{-1}

	Riccati equations $$0= M_{21}+ M_{22} W- WM_{11}- WM_{12} W$$ and
	$$W= -M_{21}- M_{22} W(I- M_{21} W)^{-1} M_{11}.$$ Here $M_{ij}$
	are given matrices (variable or constant, as the case may be) of
	suitable sizes. Most of the book is devoted to the differential Riccati
	equations and their algebraic counterparts.\par The interest in Riccati
	equations has become huge, especially in recent decades, and the
	literature on the subject comprises thousands of items, including
	dozens of books. Much of the research in Riccati equations is motivated
	by applications in mathematics, science, and engineering. Several
	areas of applications, including robust control, disturbance attenuation,
	game theory, and stochastic control, are emphasized in the reviewed
	book. From the standpoint of theoretical mathematics, Riccati equations
	represent a relatively well understood, albeit not without its own
	intricacies and subtleties, class of nonlinear equations: They can
	be linearized via the Grassmannian formulation, and exhibit several
	remarkable properties (for example, preservation of the Loewner partial
	order on Hermitian matrices). A key issue regarding Riccati equations
	involves conditions that guarantee existence of global solutions,
	i.e., solutions that do not escape in finite time.\par The reviewed
	book addresses basic properties of Riccati equations, several of
	their applications, and brings the exposition to the state of the
	art of very recent research. The subject matter is restricted to
	matrix equations (thus, leaving out Riccati equations with possibly
	unbounded operator coefficients, which are of primary importance
	in optimal control of systems governed by PDEs), and to mainly theoretical
	issues, thus de-emphasizing numerical methods (although several numerical
	algorithms and examples are presented). Within these restrictions,
	however, the book is a useful, timely, and welcome addition to the
	literature, as it brings for the first time many recent developments
	in a book form, especially on coupled and generalized equations.
	The book will definitely become a standard reference for many aspects
	of the more advanced theory and applications of matrix Riccati equations.\par
	Chapter headings, with brief comments in parentheses, are as follows:
	1. Basic results for linear equations. 2. Hamiltonian matrices and
	algebraic Riccati equations. (The first two chapters contain rather
	standard material which can be found in some form in many sources
	nowadays.) 3. Global aspects of Riccati differential and difference
	equations. (This chapter includes the study of flows on Grassmann
	manifolds and Riccati equations with periodic coefficients.) 4. Hermitian-Riccati
	differential equations. (In particular, a complete proof is presented
	of the theorem stating that the Riccati differential equation is
	essentially the only equation having the Loewner order preserving
	property.) 5. The periodic Riccati equation. (A description of positive
	semidefinite periodic equilibria is included.) 6. Coupled and generalized
	Riccati equations. (This chapter also contains applications to Nash
	and Stackelberg games, stochastic control, and Markovian jump systems.
	In Stackelberg games the players obey a hierarchical structure of
	leaders and followers, in contrast to Nash games.) 7. Symmetric differential
	Riccati equations: an operator based approach. (Here, the ``Riccati
	theory'', i.e., to quote the book, ``connections between stabilizing
	solutions to the symmetric algebraic Riccati equation, invertibility
	of the Toeplitz operator associated with the input-output operator
	of the underlying Hamiltonian system, and existence of antianalytic
	factorization of the Popov function'', is presented in the context
	of time-varying systems and the descriptor operator approach.) 8.
	Applications to robust control systems. (The material here contains
	a thorough treatment of the four-block Nehari and disturbance attenuation
	problems.) 9. Nonsymmetric Riccati theory and applications. (Extension
	of the Riccati theory to the nonsymmetric algebraic Riccati equation
	is developed, with applications in game theory, in particular, open
	loop Nash and Stackelberg equilibria.)\par The up-to-date bibliography
	is quite extensive, containing more than 400 items.}},

	that for #intrinsic# drop breakage and coalescence rates, a multiblock

  abstract = {In the previous part of this work (Chem. Eng. Sci. 54 (1999) 5887),
	a multiblock simulation model was developed in order to allow the
	close examination of different regions of a stirred tank for drop
	size distribution calculations. In this paper, that model is tested
	in a parameter fitting procedure. The drop breakage and coalescence
	parameters are fitted against drop size measurements from dense liquid-liquid
	dispersions, which were assumed fully turbulent. Since the local
	turbulence and flow values of a stirred tank are used in the present
	model, the fundamental breakage and coalescence phenomena can be
	examined more closely. Furthermore, the present model is capable
	of predicting inhomogeneities occurring in a stirred tank. It is
	also to be considered as an improved tool for process scale-up, compared
	to the simple vessel-averaged population balance approach, or use
	of correlations of dimensionless numbers only. The present model
	can use two sources of data for fitting parameters in the drop rate
	functions. One is to use transient data of the measured drop size
	distribution as the impeller speed is changed. The other is to use
	time-averaged data measured at different locations of the stirred
	tank. It is shown in this paper that the different flow regions can
	be chosen from the CFD simulations in a straightforward manner. CFD
	flow simulation results can be used to select the flow regions when
	no experimentally obtained flow conditions are available. This is
	especially useful for non-standard vessels, such as reactors containing
	cooling coils. After fitting the parameters with a multiblock model,
	the population balance model can be rather easily incorporated into
	a commercial CFD program to investigate different flow conditions.},

  journal = {Chemical Engineering Science},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {61},
  pages = {4919 - 4929},
  number = {15},
  abstract = {A solution to the moment-transformed population balance equation is
	presented. The method is based on calculating integrals with fixed
	quadrature points and corresponding moment-conserving weights. The
	quadrature points are fixed in the sense that their relative locations
	along the internal coordinate are determined based on a pre-determined
	condition. One such condition is choosing them as zeros of orthogonal
	polynomials. The collocation points are then distributed along the
	physical internal coordinate by using knowledge about the ratio of
	maximum possible internal coordinate value to its mean. The most
	promising feature of the fixed quadrature point method is that the
	selected family of orthogonal polynomials used for calculating the
	quadrature points can be further optimized based on the problem at
	hand. The method applies also to an arbitrary set of collocation
	points, which can be chosen based on the known features of the distribution
	evolution. Such example related to agglomeration of solid particles
	of constant size is shown. The present method is compared to the
	QMOM method of McGraw [1997. Description of aerosol dynamics by the
	quadrature method of moments. Aerosol Science and Technology 27,
	255-265] where quadrature points are calculated using the PD algorithm
	of Gordon [1968. Error bounds in equilibrium statistical mechanics.
	Journal of Mathematical Physics 9, 655-663]. Predictions are compared
	to analytical solutions in breakage, agglomeration and growth. Excellent
	agreements are found for both tested methods. The fixed quadrature
	method, however, is more accurate in most cases, but with a minor
	increase in computational cost, related to a slightly larger number
	of closure function calls. In the present method, an odd as well
	as an even number of moments can be used; in contrary to the PD algorithm.
	The quadrature weights are calculated from a linear transformation
	that is always non-singular. Then the time derivatives for the population
	balance equation can be uniquely solved for each time step, which
	increases the robustness of the present method. This is a very desirable
	feature when large systems are modeled, such as in process flowsheet
	and fluid dynamic simulations. The method is also extended to problems
	with multiple internal coordinates.},

  abstract = {{The optimal control problems studied in this book are governed by
	state equations of the form $Ay=Bu+f$ and $y'+Ay=Bu+f$, where $A$
	is a nonlinear accretive (multivalued) operator in a Banach space
	$X$, $B$ is a linear continuous operator from a controller space
	$U$ to $X$, and $u$ is the control parameter. The cost functional
	is in general not differentiable, and since the state equation is
	nonlinear this leads to a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem.
	The book is written in a dual perspective, analysis-synthesis taking
	into account that in contemporary mathematics control theory is complementarily
	related to the analysis of differential systems.\par The first chapter
	contains preliminaries, and the second one deals with nonlinear operators
	of monotone type. Chapter 3 is concerned with optimal control problems
	governed by variational inequalities of elliptic type and semilinear
	elliptic equations. The main emphasis is put on first order necessary
	conditions of optimality obtained by an approximating regularizing
	process. The general theory is applied to controlled free boundary
	problems such as the obstacle problem and the Signorini problem.
	Chapter 4 is devoted to the Cauchy problem associated with nonlinear
	accretive operators in Banach space. The main result is related to
	the Crandall-Liggett exponential formula for autonomous equations.
	Applications are given to nonlinear parabolic equations and variational
	inequalities, first order quasilinear equations, the nonlinear diffusion
	equations, and nonlinear hyperbolic equations. Optimal control problems
	governed by semilinear parabolic equations and by parabolic variational
	inequalities are considered in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 is concerned
	with the feedback representation of optimal controllers to problems
	considered in the previous chapter.\par The book contains an extensive

	a combination of this method with a variant of Newton's method (in
	this context also called Kleinman iteration) results in an algorithm
	for the solution of large-scale Riccati equations. Third, we describe
	an implicit version of this algorithm for the solution of linear-quadratic
	optimal control problems, which computes the feedback directly without
	solving the underlying algebraic Riccati equation explicitly. Our
	algorithms are efficient with respect to both memory and computation.
	In particular, they can be applied to problems of very large scale,

	Appliqu\'ees pour la Ma\^{\i}trise; Paris: Masson) (1983; Zbl 0511.46001)]
	and followed by numerous translations, became very popular worldwide,
	and was adopted as a textbook in many European universities. A deficiency
	of the French text was the lack of exercises. The present volume
	contains a wealth of problems. The author's aim is to give a systematic
	treatment of some of the fundamental abstract results in functional
	analysis and of their applications to certain concrete problems in
	linear differential and partial differential equations. Moreover,
	by interlacing extensive commentary and foreshadowing subsequent
	developments within the formal scheme of statements and proofs, by
	the inclusion of many apt examples and by appending interesting and
	challenging exercises, the author has written a book which is eminently
	suitable as a text for a graduate course. This volume is distinguished
	by the broad variety of problems which have been treated and by the
	abstract results which are developed. The content of the book is
	divided into 11 chapters, as follows: I. The Hahn-Banach theorems.
	Introduction to the theory of conjugate convex functions; II. The
	Banach-Steinhaus and closed graph theorems. Orthogonality relations.
	Unbounded operators. The notion of adjoint. Characterization of surjective
	operators; III. Weak topologies. Reflexive spaces. Separable spaces.
	Uniformly convex spaces; IV. $L^p$-spaces; V. Hilbert spaces; VI.
	Compact operators. Spectral decomposition of compact selfadjoint
	operators; VII. The Hille-Yosida theorem; VIII. Sobolev spaces and
	variational formulation of boundary value problems in dimension one;
	IX. Sobolev spaces and variational formulation of boundary value
	problems in dimension $N$; X. Evolution problems: the heat equation
	and the wave equation; XI. Miscellaneous Complements. Following Chapter
	XI, there are solutions for selected exercises (a significant number
	of complete solutions for the exercises following each chapter are
	included). Next, a list of 51 problems follows. These are mostly
	theorems, or otherwise theoretical results, the proofs of which could
	be treated separately from the main text. Finally, there is a section
	of hints and partial solutions for the set of 51 problems. In summary,
	this book is a tour-de-force by the author, who is a master of modern
	nonlinear functional analysis and who has contributed extensively
	to the development of the theory of partial differential equations.
	The volume under review deals rigorously with mathematical models
	of a certain applicability to the real world. From this viewpoint,
	it is a significant contribution to a currently active area of research.
	Globally, the reviewer very much likes the spirit and the scope of
	the book. The writing is lively, the material is diverse and maintains
	a strong unity. The interplay between the abstract functional analysis
	and relevant concrete problems arising in applications is emphasized
	throughout. On balance, the book is a very useful contribution to
	the growing literature on this circle of ideas. I wholeheartedly
	recommend this book both as a textbook, and for independent study.}},

  abstract = {{This text is an introduction to model predictive control, a control
	methodology which has encountered some success in industry (beyond
	the PID strategy), but which still presents many theoretical challenges
	(stability, robustness). The first edition was published in 1999
	by Springer, London. The authors limit the scope mainly to linear
	processes and they represent them in the frequency domain. They present
	many commercial schemes. Chapter four considers generalized predictive
	control for noisy processes. Next, some practical issues are addressed:
	the authors connect the previous formulation with data available
	from plants in industry. Chapter six deals with multivariable processes.
	Chapter seven studies constraints in this context. Chapter eight
	considers robustness issues. The next chapters are specific to this
	second edition with topics on nonlinear processes and hybrid systems.
	The last chapter is devoted to applications (solar power plant, pilot
	for a chemical plant (heat exchanger), sugar refinery, olive oil
	mill, mobile robot). Many other applications are described along
	the way though; they belong to the chemical industry. Two appendices
	detail some optimization algorithms (simplex method, linear quadratic
	control). Many exercises are included at the end of the chapters,

	$N: R\sp n\times R\sp m\mapsto R\sp m$. The method involves applying
	the basic iteration S of a general solver for the equation $G(u,t)=0$,
	with t fixed. It is therefore well suited for problems for which
	such a solver already exists or can be implemented more efficiently
	than a solver for the coupled system. We derive conditions for S
	under which the method is locally convergent. Basically, if S is
	sufficiently contractive for G, then convergence for the coupled
	system is guaranteed. Otherwise, we show how to construct an $\hat
	S$ from S for which convergence is assured. These results are applied
	to continuation methods where N represents a pseudo-arclength condition.
	We show that under certain conditions the algorithm converges if
	S is convergent for G. Numerical results are given for a two-level

	just toy-type, problems. \par The overall presentation has two basic
	threads. The first involves close consideration of four affine invariances
	for Newton's method applied to a nonlinear mapping $F$ between Banach
	spaces: (1) Affine covariance: The iterates are invariant under affine
	transformations of the image space. (2) Affine contravariance: Under
	affine transformations of the domain space the iterates transform
	in the same way. (3) Affine conjugacy: If $F$ is a gradient mapping
	then under an affine transformation of the domain space the Jacobian
	transformation is conjugate. (4) Affine similarity: In the case of
	identical domain and image spaces an affine transformation induces
	a similarity transformation of the Jacobian. \par The second thread
	is a computational paradigm central to the construction of adaptive
	Newton algorithms: Affine-invariant computational estimates of affine
	invariant Lipschitz constants are cheaply available in the course
	of the algorithms, while, without strict observation of the affine
	invariance of the Lipschitz conditions geometric distortions lead
	to totally unrealistic estimates. \par After an introductory chapter
	covering the basic background and terminology, the book is divided
	into two parts. The first part concerns Newton methods in finite
	dimensions. Different affine invariant Lipschitz conditions lead
	to different local convergence domains in terms of different norms.
	In particular, the above named invariances (1), (2), and (3) give
	rise to algorithms that are controlled by error norms, residual norms,
	and energy norms, respectively. The details are worked out for different
	types of Newton algorithms and then globalization concepts are surveyed,
	such as steepest descent methods, trust region methods, Levenberg
	Marquardt methods, and Newton's method with damping strategies. Affine
	invariance also plays an important role in local and global Gauss-Newton
	methods for nonlinear least squares. In addition, adaptive continuation
	processes for parameter dependent nonlinear equations are discussed
	and attention is also directed to augmented systems for determining
	selected critical points. \par The second part of the book turns
	to infinite-dimensional problems. For stiff initial value problems
	for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) a simplified Newton method
	is analyzed as a replacement of the standard Picard iteration that,
	typically, is suitable only for nonstiff problems. For nonlinear
	two-point ODE boundary value problems an adaptive multilevel collocation
	method is applied and analyzed as an inexact Newton method in function
	space. Finally, the last chapter addresses asymptotic mesh independence
	and the use of inexact Newton multilevel finite element methods for
	solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDE) boundary value
	problems. \par Throughout the text algorithms are presented as informal
	programs. Many of these have been implemented in detail and were
	used for various numerical examples. Web sites for these codes are
	provided. \par In many parts the presentation covers unpublished
	material and also points to possible future research areas and relevant
	topics that have not been included. As such the book is certainly
	a research monograph. However, the form of the presentation also
	makes selected parts well accessible for use as text material in
	appropriate courses. All in all, this is an excellent contribution
	to the computational analysis of nonlinear equations that should
	be of interest to anyone interested in this area.}},

	equation. The Riccati equation is nonlinear, and a "multiple embedding"
	setting must be used. The entire method is then fit theoretically
	into a multiple shooting-like framework, and the original BVP as
	a chain of subproblems is studied. In this way, a generalized decoupling
	result is presented which enables the study of stability to be brought

	gas-solid flows are carried out assuming that the solid phase is
	monodispersed, whereas it is well known that in many applications,
	it is characterized by a particle size distribution (PSD). In order
	to properly model the evolution of a polydisperse solid phase, the
	population balance equation (PBE) must be coupled to the continuity
	and momentum balance equations. In this work, the recently formulated
	direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) is implemented in a multi-fluid
	CFD code to simulate particle aggregation and breakage in a fluidized-bed
	(FB) reactor. DQMOM is implemented in the code by representing each
	node of the quadrature approximation as a distinct solid phase. Since
	in the multi-fluid model, each solid phase has its own momentum balance,
	the nodes of the DQMOM approximation are convected with their own
	velocities. This represents an important improvement with respect
	to the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) where the moments are
	tracked using an average solid velocity. Two different aggregation
	and breakage kernels are tested and the performance of the DQMOM
	approximation with different numbers of nodes are compared. These
	results show that the approach is very effective in modeling solid
	segregation and elutriation and in tracking the evolution of the
	PSD, even though it requires only a small number of scalars.},

	open problems, however, have remained open until recently, and some
	have never been solved. This book is a survey of all results know
	to the author, with emphasis on very recent results (1999 to date).
	The book is restricted to linear equations and two particular problems
	(the time optimal problem, the norm optimal problem) which results
	in a more focused and concrete treatment. As experience shows, results
	on linear equations are the basis for the treatment of their semilinear
	counterparts, and techniques for the time and norm optimal problems
	can often be generalized to more general cost functionals. The main
	object of this book is to be a state-of-the-art monograph on the
	theory of the time and norm optimal controls for $y'(t) = Ay(t) +
	u(t)$ that ends at the very latest frontier of research, with open
	problems and indications for future research. Key features: -- Applications
	to optimal diffusion processes; -- applications to optimal heat propagation
	processes; -- modelling of optimal processes governed by partial

  author = {Hairer, Ernst and Lubich, Christian and Roche, Michel},
  address = {Berlin},
  abstract = {{In this monograph the authors systematically study application of
	implicit and semi-explicit Runge-Kutta methods for discrete approximation
	to differential-algebraic systems of ordinary differential equations.
	Applications to singularly perturbed systems are also included. The
	systems are classified according to the permutation index of the
	system, i.e. the behavior of the residual under a small perturbation
	of the solution. \par It is shown that the appropriate choice of
	the Runge-Kutta method depends directly on the index of the system.
	Explicit choices are discussed for indices $m=1,2,3$ (systems in
	normal form have index $m=0)$. Numerical results are presented for
	a number of interesting applications. A new code RADAU 5 in Fortran
	is presented for a 3-stage Radau IIA Runge-Kutta method which is
	applicable for indices $m=1,2,3.$ \par Given a system of differential
	equations in implicit form $F(Y',Y)=0$ the equation has perturbation
	index m along a solution Y on [0,b] if for all Z near Y the defect
	$\delta (x)=F(Z',Z)$ satisfies $$ \Vert Z(x)- Y(x)\Vert \le C(\Vert
	Z(0)-Y(0)\Vert +\sum\sp{m-1}\sb{j=0}\max\sb{0\le t\le x}\Vert \delta\sp{(j)}(t)\Vert).
	$$ The authors employ the following canonical forms for systems with
	indices $m=1,2,3:$ 1) $m=1$, $y'=f(y,z),\quad g(y,z)=0$ and $g\sb
	z$ is invertible. 2) $m=2$, $y'=f(y,z),\quad g(y)=0,$ and $g\sb yf\sb
	z$ has a bounded inverse. 3) $m=3$, $y'=f(y,z),\quad z'=k(y,z,u),\quad
	0=g(y,u)$ and $g\sb yf\sb zk\sb u$ has a bounded inverse. Which Runge-Kutta
	algorithm may be applied to a system depends on which of these forms
	it assumes. The applicable implicit Runge-Kutta methods are classified
	following {\it J. C. Butcher} [The numerical analysis of ordinary
	differential equations (1987; Zbl 0616.65072)] and {\it K. Dekker}
	and {\it J. G. Verwer} [Stability of Runge-Kutta methods for stiff
	nonlinear differential equations (1984; Zbl 0571.65057)] according
	to whether Gauss, Radau, or Lobatto quadrature is used. The specific
	algorithms considered are Gauss, Radau IA, IIA, and Lobatto IIIA,
	IIIC. In addition singly diagonal methods of {\it R. Alexander} [SIAM
	J. Numer. Anal. 14, 1006-1021 (1977; Zbl 0374.65038)] and of {\it
	S. P. N{\o}rsett} and {\it P. Thomsen} [BIT 26, 100-113 (1986; Zbl
	0627.65082)] are covered. \par The notion of perturbation index and
	the classification of differential- algebraic systems is presented
	in chapter 1. Chapter 2 contains a review of Runge-Kutta methods
	for ordinary differential and differential- algebraic equations including
	methods for singularly perturbed systems. Chapters 3-6 select and
	describe methods appropriate respectively for indices $m=1,2,3$.
	Proofs of convergence of the methods are presented including convergence
	for associated perturbed systems. Chapter 7 presents a simplified
	Newton method applicable to the relevant algorithms and chapter 8
	concerns local error estimation. In chapter 9 a summary of numerical
	results is given for a number of interesting applications and chapter
	10 presents the code RADAU 5. \par The material presented in the
	monograph represents recent research by many authors which is published
	here for the first time in a unified form. A comprehensive bibliography

	Es gen\"ugt den verschiedensten Anforderungen, die man an ein derartiges
	Werk stellen kann: Das behandelte Gebiet wird mit der gr\"o{\ss}ten
	Kennerschaft dargestellt, es ist \"au{\ss}erst \"ubersichtlich aufgebaut,
	die Sachverhalte werden, ausgehend von einfachen Situationen und
	das Verst\"andnis entwickelnd, erkl\"art, es kommen historische,
	theoretische, praktisch numerische Gesichtspunkte gleicherma{\ss}en
	zur Geltung, die Pr\"asentation ist nicht zuletzt durch die enthaltenen
	105 Figuren sehr anschaulich und zudem ist es gelungen, einen bei
	einem mathematischen Buch seltener zu findenden kurzweiligen, ja
	geradezu am\"usanten Stil zu entwickeln. Alles in allem ist es ein
	Vergn\"ugen, die 432 Seiten Text (48 S. beinhaltend Programmlistungen,
	Referenzen und Indizes treten noch hinzu) zu studieren. \par Das
	Buch gliedert sich in drei Kapitel: I: Classical Mathematical Theory
	(125 S.), II: Runge-Kutta und Extrapolation Methods (175 S.), III:
	Multistep Methods and General Linear Methods (128 S.). \par In einer
	Monografie \"uber numerische Methoden bei Differentialgleichungen
	brauchte das vorliegende erste Kapitel nicht unbedingt enthalten
	zu sein, ein Verzicht darauf w\"urde die Seitenzahl (und den Verkaufspreis)
	herunterdr\"ucken. Aber ganz offensichtlich wollten die Autoren ihre
	Sicht der Dinge loswerden, und sie haben dabei von der Sache her
	gutgetan. Dieses Kapitel sollte man nicht vergessen heranzuziehen,
	wenn es um eine Vorlesung \"uber die Grundlagen der Theorie gew\"ohnlicher
	Differentialgleichungen geht. Unter seinen 16 Abschnitten sind die
	\"Uberschriften ``Differential Inequalities'', ``Stability'', ``Periodic
	Solutions, Limit Cycles, Strange Attractors'' zu finden. Im zweiten
	Kapitel findet sich alles zu den Runge-Kutta- Verfahren bei nichtsteifen
	Differentialgleichungen. Sehr genau werden die Ordnungsbedingungen
	(Kap. II.2: Order Conditions for RK Methods, II.11: Composition of
	B-Series, II.14: P-Series for Partitioned Ordinary Differential Equations)
	und die asymptotischen Entwicklungen (dieses sp\"ater auch f\"ur
	Mehrschrittverfahren in Kap. III.9) einschlie{\ss}lich der Extrapolationsverfahren
	behandelt (Kapitel II.8, II.9). Die Abschnitte II.4, II.5, II.10
	sind exklusiv praktischen Gesichtspunkten gewidmet wie Fehlersch\"atzungen
	und Schrittweitensteuerung (u.a. eingebettete Runge-Kutta-Verfahren,
	spezielle Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg-Verfahren und Formeln von Dormand
	und Prince) und anderen numerischen Fragen (u.a. Ausgabe der L\"osung,
	speziell stetig eingebettete Formeln, Startschrittweite), wobei instruktive
	numerische Studien angegeben werden, dies auch in vielen weiteren
	Abschnitten. Zu diesen geh\"oren ``Higher Derivative Methods'', ``Numerical
	Methods for Second Order Differential Equations'', ``Delay Differential
	Equations''. Die ersten vier Abschnitte des dritten Kapitels enthalten
	alles Gel\"aufige und noch mehr aus der Theorie der Mehrschrittverfahren
	auf uniformen Gittern. Abschnitt III.5 ist den Methoden auf variablen
	Gittern, III.6 den Nordsieck-Methoden (in gro{\ss}er Klarheit) gewidmet.
	Auch hier ist ein Abschnitt numerischer Gesichtspunkte unter Einbeziehung
	der wichtigsten existierenden Implementationen vorhanden. In Abschnitt
	III.8 wird ein Schritt auf eine Theorie allgemeiner linearer Methoden
	unternommen; zu diesem Thema sollte man auch Kapitel 4 des Buches
	von {\it J. C. Butcher} [The numerical analysis of ordinary differential
	equations. Runge-Kutta and general linear methods (1987; Zbl 0616.65072)]
	konsultieren. Das dritte Kapitel schlie{\ss}t mit einem reichhaltigen
	Abschnitt \"uber Mehrschrittverfahren f\"ur Gleichungen 2. Ordnung.

  abstract = {{Nach dem Erscheinen des ersten Bandes vor vier Jahren (1987; Zbl
	0638.65058) \"uber nicht steife Probleme war der vorliegende Band
	von vielen Kollegen, die ich gesprochen habe, zunehmend ungeduldiger
	erwartet worden. Nun, da er mit einem Umfang von knapp 600 Seiten
	vorliegt, f\"allt es leicht festzustellen, da{\ss} alle Erwartungen
	\"ubertroffen sein sollten. Ein in jeder Hinsicht so gut gelungenes
	Buch findet man nur selten, und in dem behandelten Gebiet der steifen
	Anfangswertaufgaben wird es f\"ur lange Jahre Nr. 1 in den Charts
	sein. \par Genau genommen sind in diesem Band zwei B\"ucher enthalten,
	da die Verfasser es mit den steifen Problemen allein nicht haben
	genug sein lassen, sondern zu den zwei Kapiteln IV: Stiff Problem
	- One-Step Methods (254 S.) und V: Multistep Methods for Stiff Problems
	(144 S.) noch ein sechstes: Singular Perturbation Problems and Differential-Algebraic
	Equations (146 S.) hizugef\"ugt haben. Die Erweiterung des Inhalts
	um diese Komponente macht das Buch noch einmal gewichtiger als es
	ohnehin mit den beiden anderen Kapiteln allein schon w\"are, zumal
	die Autoren aus ihren eigenen Forschungsergebnissen auch zu dem Thema
	des Kapitels VI sch\"opfen konnten. \par Die magere Zahl von nur
	drei Kapiteln k\"onnte zu dem Fehlschlu{\ss} eines knappen Inhalts
	veranlassen, wo das Buch im Gegenteil an Vollst\"andigkeit keinen
	Wunsch offen lassen d\"urfte. Dies wird auch sofort an den $15+9+9$
	Abschnitten erkennbar, in die die Kapitel unterteilt sind, die ihrerseits
	sich wieder in insgesamt 235 Paragraphen untergliedern. Hinzu treten
	noch zu jedem Abschnitt \"Ubungsaufgaben, die allerdings oft den
	Charakter einer erg\"anzenden Fortsetzung des gerade pr\"asentierten
	Materials annehmen. Zudem haben die Autoren in einem Anhang die Beschreibung
	von sechs Subroutinen f\"ur steife Probleme hinzugef\"ugt, zu denen
	die kodierten Programme von den Verfassern erh\"altlich sind. Nicht
	deutlicher als durch diesen Anhang (und die Abschnitte \"uber umfangreiche
	vergleichende numerische Experimente mit diesen und anderen existierenden
	Codes) h\"atte die Bedeutung sichtbar gemacht werden k\"onnen, die
	die Autoren auf praktisch numerische Gesichtspunkte legen, bei aller
	Tiefe und gro{\ss}er Eleganz der mathematischen Analyse. \par Wenn
	auch der Inhalt des vorliegenden Bandes mit dem Wort ``umfassend''
	schon genau beschrieben ist, so sollen doch einige Themen explizit
	genannt werden. Bereits in Abschnitt IV.4 werden die order stars
	eingef\"uhrt, was nicht verwunderlich ist, wo die Autoren diese Theorie
	so entscheidend mit gepr\"agt haben. Implizite Runge-Kutta-Verfahren
	einschlie{\ss}lich DIRK- und SDIRK-Verfahren - und bei diesen Autoren
	selbstverst\"andlich auch Rosenbrock-Methoden - werden aufs Feinste
	abgehandelt. Es fehlen nicht die Extrapolationsmethoden, deren Darstellung
	beispielsweise einen eleganten Beweis des Satzes von Bader und Deuflhard
	\"uber die Existenz asymptotischer Entwicklungen, Figuren zu den
	sich ergebenden Stabilit\"atsgebieten der extrapolierten Verfahren
	und zwei Codes (basierend auf der linear impliziten Mittelpunktsregel
	sowie auf dem linear impliziten Eulerverfahren) enth\"alt. Kapitel
	IV ist damit noch lange nicht zu Ende, es folgt eine ausf\"uhrliche
	Behandlung der verschiedenen Stabilit\"atsbegriffe (A-Stabilit\"at,
	AN-Stabilit\"at, B-Stabilit\"at, Kontraktivit\"at, algebraische Stabilit\"at,
	(k,1)- Stabilit\"at) und ihrer Zusammenh\"ange untereinander. An
	dieser Stelle findet sich auch ausgef\"uhrt der Satz der Verfasser
	\"uber die Charakterisierung algebraisch stabiler Methoden f\"ur
	Runge-Kutta- Verfahren, die zu Quadraturformeln mit positiven Gewichten
	geh\"oren. Auch nicht ausgelassen werden die Ergebnisse zur B-Konvergenz,
	dem f\"ur steife Probleme angemessenen Konvergenzbegriff, und nat\"urlich
	gibt es einen Abschnitt \"uber die Existenz und Eindeutigkeit von
	L\"osungen f\"ur implizite Runge-Kutta-Verfahren. \par In Kapitel
	V wird die Erwartung nicht entt\"auscht, da{\ss} ein Abschnitt \"uber
	Order Stars auf Riemannschen Fl\"achen existiert, wozu selbstverst\"andlich
	der Beweis der Daniel-and-Moore-Conjecture geh\"ort. Vorher werden
	Resultate \"uber A-stabile und A($\alpha$)-stabile Mehrschrittverfahren
	dargestellt, hierbei etwa das Disc-Theorem von Jeltsch und Nevanlinna.
	Einige Abschnitte sind Konvergenzresultaten von Mehrschrittverfahren
	bei steifen Problem gewidmet. Hierzu geh\"ort die Dahlquistsche G-Stabilit\"at
	f\"ur one-leg Methoden, aber es werden auch nicht-A-stabile Verfahren
	betrachtet, sowohl f\"ur lineare Differentialgleichungen (u.a. beruhend
	auf einer Anwendung des Matrixtheorems von Kreiss) als auch f\"ur
	nichtlineare Aufgaben (Multiplier-Technik sowie diskrete Variation
	der Konstanten- St\"orungstechnik). Kapitel V schlie{\ss}t mit der
	Behandlung der auf Butcher und Burrage zur\"uckgehenden Klasse allgemeiner
	linearer Methoden. \par Das letzte Kapitel \"uber Algebro-Differentialgleichungen
	enth\"alt in seinem ersten Teil u.a. Konvergenzbeweise f\"ur Runge-Kutta-,
	linear implizites Euler- sowie Rosenbrockverfahren f\"ur Index 1-Probleme,
	wobei scharfe Konvergenzordnungs-Aussagen mit Hilfe asymptotischer
	Entwicklungen gewonnen werden. Es folgt dann die L\"osung von Index
	2- Problemen, vor allem mit den BDF-Formeln und Runge-Kutta-Verfahren.
	Das letzte Kapitel und damit das Buch insgesamt endet mit einem Bonbon
	aus der Theorie der Ordnungsbedingungen f\"ur Index 2-Systeme und
	einem weiteren aus der numerischen Berechnung eines Mehrk\"orpersystems
	unter Nebenbedingungen. \par Bleibt nur noch zu sagen, da{\ss} die
	animierende Pr\"asentation des Gebietes dem ersten Band entsprechend
	beibehalten worden ist. Viele graphisch ansprechende Figuren und
	das mit TEX optisch angenehm gestaltete Layout machen zus\"atzlich
	einen Blick in das Buch zur Freude.}},

	a unique lecture-style format, making the book easy to use for students.
	The book is specifically designed as a one-semester textbook. It
	is structured into 25 lectures, each to be covered in two hours of
	lecture time. The material is divided into six parts. The first part
	(lectures 1--7) deals with system representation including state-space
	linear systems, linearization, Laplace transform, impulse response,
	the Jordan normal form, and computation of matrix exponentials. In
	the second part (lectures 8--10) Lyapunov stability theory for continuous
	and discrete time cases, input-output stability and preview of optimal
	control are expounded. Part III (lectures 11--14) focuses on the
	fundamental concepts of controllability, reachability and stabilizability.
	Lecture 11 introduces the notions of controllability and reachability,
	which are the basis of all state-space control design methods while
	lecture 12 introduces the notion of a controllable system and presents
	several tests to determine whether a system is controllable. Lecture
	13 deals with controllable decompositions, and lecture 14 introduces
	the concept of stabilizability. Observability and output feedback
	are considered in part IV (lectures 15--17). Observability and constructibility
	Gramians are defined, continuous and discrete cases are considered
	here. Controllability and observability matrices are defined, detectability
	tests are stated in this part. The canonical Kalman decomposition
	is presented and the stabilization of systems by output feedback
	is discussed. Advanced material of this book starts with Part V (lectures
	18--19). Polynomial matrices, Smith-McMillan factorization, transmission-blocking
	property of transmission zeros are considered in lecture 18. Chapter
	19 is dedicated to state-space zeros, minimality and system inverses.
	Part VI (lectures 20--25) is concerned with LQR/LQG optimal control.
	Linear quadratic regulation (LQR), the algebraic Riccati equation,
	frequency domain and asymptotic properties of LQR are considered
	in lectures 20--22. An mechanical example (aircraft roll dynamics)
	is considered as the application of the above theory. Lectures 23--25
	are devoted to output feedback, LQG/LQR parametrization and $Q$ design.
	The book is addressed to a wide audience of students and professionals
	such as mathematicians, applied researches and practitioners.}},

	parabolic problems cannot be realistically assumed in the case of

	by partial differential equations (PDEs) and algorithms for obtaining
	their solutions. Solving optimization problems with constraints given
	in terms of PDEs is one of the most challenging problems appearing,
	e.g., in industry, medical and economical applications. The book
	consists of four chapters. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to
	analytical background and optimality theory for optimization problems
	with PDEs. First, necessary background in functional analysis, Sobolev
	spaces, the theory of week solutions for elliptic and parabolic equations
	and G{\'a}teaux and Fr{\'e}chet differentiability are presented.
	Next, existence of optimal controls both for linear quadratic and
	nonlinear abstract problems in Hilbert spaces are considered. Further,
	first order optimality conditions for problems described by PDEs
	with control and state constraints are derived. Elliptic, parabolic
	and Navier-Stokes optimal control problems are used as illustrative
	examples. The second chapter presents a selection of important algorithms
	for optimization problems with PDEs. Several variants of generalized
	Newton methods in Banach spaces are derived and analysed. Problems
	of convergence of the considered algorithms are discussed in details.
	Elliptic and Navier-Stokes optimal control problems are used as illustrative
	examples. The third chapter gives an introduction to discrete concepts
	for optimization problems with PDEs constraints. Two approaches:
	``First discretize, then optimize'' and ``First optimize, then discretize''
	are compared and discussed. Several numerical examples together with
	error analysis are presented. The final fourth chapter is devoted
	to the study of two industrial applications in which optimization
	with PDEs plays a crucial role. Two problems from modern semiconductor
	design and glass industry are described in details together with
	their numerical studies of related optimal control problems. Every

	discretization, a discrete concept which avoids explicit discretization

	or less organised according to definition, genesis and historical
	remarks, moments, estimation of parameters, relations to other distributions.
	The $F$-, $t$-, and $\chi\sp 2$- distributions are of less interest
	in modelling, so estimation is almost no topic in these chapters.\par
	Many new examples of applications of distributions are included.
	Also numerous results relating to approximations are included. The
	number of references increased almost threefold (to over 2100 items).
	They are given at the end of the chapters.\par In summary, it can
	be said again: This second edition of ``Distributions in statistics''
	will serve as the primary source for statistical distributions for
	a long time.}},

  title = {{Iterative methods for optimization.}},

  author = {Kelley, C.T.},
  abstract = {{This book gives an introduction to optimization methods for unconstrained
	and bound constrained minimization problems. The style of the book
	is probably best described by the following quote from the book's
	preface: `\dots{} we treat a small number of methods in depth, giving
	less detailed description of only a few [\dots{}]. We aim for clarity
	and brevity rather than complete generality and confine our scope
	to algorithms that are easy to implement (by the reader!) and understand.'
	\par This book is partitioned into two parts. The first part, occupying
	approximately 100 pages, is devoted to the optimization of smooth
	functions. The methods studied in this first part rely on the availability
	and accuracy of first order, and sometimes also second order derivatives
	of the objective function. The first part contains five chapters.
	The first chapter provides basic concepts. It also introduces a parameter
	identification problem and a discretized optimal control problem,
	both of which are used to demonstrate all methods discussed in the
	first part. Chapter 2 studies the local convergence of Newton's method,
	inexact Newton methods, and the Gauss-Newton method for the solution
	of nonlinear least squares problems. Both, overdetermined and underdetermined
	nonlinear least squares problems are considered. Chapter 3 is devoted
	to line-search and trust-region methods, which are used to globalize
	convergence, i.e., remove the restriction that the starting point
	of the optimization iteration is sufficiently close to a solution.
	\par The BFGS method is studied in chapter 4. A local convergence
	analysis is provided and implementation details are discussed. Other
	quasi-Newton methods are sketched. The last chapter of the first
	part, chapter 5, studies projection methods for the solution of bound
	constrained problems. All chapters conclude with a demonstration
	of the methods discussed in the respective chapter using the parameter
	identification problem and the discretized optimal control problem
	introduced in chapter 1, and with a set of exercises. \par The second
	part of the book, which is approximately 50 pages long, deals with
	the optimization of noisy functions. Such optimization problems arise,
	e.g., when the evaluation of the objective function involves computer
	simulations. In such cases the noise often introduces artificial
	minimizers. Gradient information, even if available, cannot expected
	to be reliable. This second part contains three chapters. The first
	chapter provides a discussion of noisy functions, basics concepts,
	and three simple examples that are later used to demonstrate the
	behavior of optimization algorithms. Chapter 7 introduces implicit
	filtering, a technique due to the author and his group. Implicit
	filtering methods use finite difference approximations of the gradient,
	which are adjusted to the noise level in the function. Direct search
	algorithms, including the Nelder-Mead, multidirectional search, and
	the Hooke-Jeves algorithms are discussed in Chapter 8. Again, the
	latter two chapters conclude with a numerical demonstration of the
	methods discussed in the respective chapter, and with a set of exercises.
	\par The treatment of both, optimization methods for smooth and for
	noisy functions is a unique feature of this book. Matlab implementations
	of all algorithms discussed in this book are easily accessible from
	the author's or the publisher's web-page.}},

	students who feel they are up to the chalenge of the beautiful and
	complex world of CFD". Thus, the purpose of the book is to allow
	graduate students to progress from essentially zero to finite element
	CFD, and even to include one advanced topic in the field (such as
	turbulence) in one academic term. The book goal is to connect ideas
	from the numerical analysis of Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) without
	losing understanding what fluid flow simulations really mean. Each
	chapter is self-contained as possible. Part I begins with a chapter
	devoted to mathematical preliminaries. Chapter 2 introduces FEM in
	detail to begin the treatment of NSE. Chapter 3 covers and reviews
	vectors, tensors, and conservation laws, which is necessary to go
	farther in CFD. Part II opens with Chapter 4, which presents mixed
	methods for Stokes problem. A derivation of NSE and the properties
	of solutions that are essential to understand their numerical features
	are the topics of Chapter 5. The theory of steady NSE and their numerical
	analysis are the aim of Chapter 6 and 7, respectively. Part III considers
	time-dependent fluid flows beginning with a summary of the Leray
	theory for NSE in Chapter 8. Chapter 8 proves also stability of finite
	element methods for time-dependent NSE, backing upon the energy equality.
	The final topic mentions the enormous variety of fluid flow phenomena
	from the turbulence. But the author restricts himself to the presentation
	of homogeneous isotropic turbulence (Chapter 10). Each chapter on
	the theory is followed by a chapter on numerical analysis that expands
	the theory. The chapters contain numerous exercises. With mathematical
	rigor and physical clarity, this book provides a useful tool for
	understanding the foundations of methods commonly used for flow simulations.}},

	(CF-ADI) algorithm, which generates a low-rank approximation to the

	matrix A is assumed to be large, and the rank of the right-hand side
	$-BB^{T}$ is assumed to be much smaller than the size of A. The CF-ADI
	algorithm requires only matrix-vector products and matrix-vector
	solves by shifts of A. Hence, it enables one to take advantage of
	any sparsity or structure in A. This paper also discusses the approximation
	of the dominant invariant subspace of the solution X. We characterize
	a group of spanning sets for the range of X. A connection is made
	between the approximation of the dominant invariant subspace of X
	and the generation of various low-order Krylov and rational Krylov
	subspaces. It is shown by numerical examples that the rational Krylov
	subspace generated by the CF-ADI algorithm, where the shifts are
	obtained as the solution of a rational minimax problem, often gives

  abstract = {{This book is a valuable addition to the literature on system identification
	and parameter estimation. Its rigorous treatment of the main topics
	in the system identification field should appeal to the mathematically-minded
	reader. The book addresses to all of those who want to get a firm
	grip on the basic system identification techniques that are currently
	available. The book contains 17 chapters and 2 appendices, which
	are briefly reviewed in the following. \par Part i: Systems and models
	\par Chapter 1 introduces, in an informal way, the basic entities
	of an identification exercise. Chapter 2 discusses time-invariant
	linear systems described by impulse responses and transfer functions,
	and introduces some basic notions on signal spectra and description
	of the disturbances. Chapter 3 discusses three main applications
	in which a system description is useful: simulation, prediction and
	control. Chapter 4 introduces a general family of transfer-function
	and state-space models and derives a number of results on their identifiability
	properties. Chapter 5 contains a brief discussion about time-varying
	and nonlinear models. \par Part ii: Methods \par Chapter 6 presents
	several nonparametric time- and frequency-domain methods, such as
	transient analysis, correlation analysis, Fourier and spectral analysis.
	Chapter 7 describes two general methods for parameter estimation:
	the prediction error method (PEM) and the correlation method (CM),
	which are shown to contain many other estimation methods as special
	cases. Chapter 8 establishes the consistency and identifiability
	properties of PEM and CM, and Chapter 9 derives the asymptotic distributions
	of the parameter estimates provided by these two general methods.
	Chapters 10 and 11 discuss various off-line and, respectively, on-line
	techniques to compute the PEM and CM estimates, and analyse the main
	problems associated with these techniques (such as convergence, numerical
	accuracy and fast implementation). \par Part iii: User's choice \par
	Chapter 12 discusses the options and objectives that a user of system
	identification methods may have. Chapters 13, 14 and 15 attempt to
	provide some general answers to such important problems as experiment
	design and choice of an identification criterion. Chapter 16 discusses
	various techniques for model structure selection and model validation,
	and Chapter 17 presents two identification exercises. Finally, Appendix
	I contains a brief discussion of some concepts from the probability
	theory, and Appendix II presents the basic results on linear regressions.}},

  abstract = {The implementation of a population balance equation (PBE) in computational
	fluid dynamics (CFD) represents a crucial element in the simulation
	of multiphase flows. Some of the available methods, such as classes
	methods (CM) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods, are computationally expensive
	and simulation of real cases of practical interest requires intractable
	CPU times. On the other hand, other methods such as the method of
	moments (MOM) are computationally affordable but have proven to be
	inaccurate for a number of cases. In recent work a new closure, the
	quadrature method of moments (QMOM), has been introduced, applied
	and validated. In our earlier work, QMOM was shown to be an efficient
	and accurate method for tracking the moments of the particle size
	distribution (PSD) in a CFD simulation. However, QMOM presents two
	main disadvantages: (i) if applied to multi-variate distributions
	it loses simplicity and efficiency, and (ii) by tracking only the
	moments of the PSD, it does not represent realistically polydisperse
	systems with strong coupling between the internal coordinates and
	phase velocities. In order to address these issues, in this work
	the direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) is formulated, validated,
	and tested. DQMOM is based on the idea of tracking directly the variables
	appearing in the quadrature approximation, rather than tracking the
	moments of the PSD. Nevertheless, for monovariate cases we show that
	QMOM and DQMOM yield identical results. In addition, we show how
	it is possible to extend the DQMOM to multivariate cases and some
	of relevant theoretical and numerical issues are discussed. These
	issues are discussed in the present work for homogeneous and one-dimensional
	flows. References to recent CFD applications of DQMOM to multiphase
	flows are provided as further proof of the utility of the method.},

  abstract = {{The book provides an excellent survey of theoretical results on finite-dimensional
	functional analysis. The Newton method for solving nonlinear systems
	surves as a basis where a variety of its modifications is presented,
	problems related to local and global convergence are studied, iterative
	methods for numerical solutions are considered. \par The book includes
	five parts, subdivided in fourteen chapters, a bibliography involving
	about 850 papers and books, an Index and a Glossary of symbols. Each
	chapter is subdivided in sections, most of which are supplemented
	with ``Notes and Remarks'' giving some additional results to the
	problems discussed as well as a specified list of references. There
	are also exercises included which make the book very useful for graduate
	students and others working in this field. \par Part I (Chapters
	1 to 3) has an introductory character. It collects background material
	from analysis and linear algebra used in following parts. Chapter
	1 presents several typical mathematical problems leading to solutions
	of nonlinear systems. Chapter 2 is devoted to linear algebra problems
	such as eigenvalue problems, matrix norms, invertibility of linear
	operators in $\bbfR^n$, partial order relations. Chapter 3 includes
	$n$-dimensional calculus, G\^ateaux and Fr\'echet derivatives, convex
	functionals and their properties. \par Part II (Chapters 4 to 6)
	presents various existence and uniqueness theorems with nonconstructive
	proofs. Chapter 4 studies gradient operators, rising from minimization
	problems as well as convex functionals. In Chapter 5, contraction
	mapping theorems for inverse and implicit function are proved and
	continuations of local homeomorphisms to global ones are considered.
	Chapter 6 is devoted to the theory of the degree of a mapping, which
	allows simple proofs of known fixed point theorems and is used to
	study monotone and coercive mappings. \par Part III (Chapters 7 and
	8) describes the most common iterative methods for solving systems
	of nonlinear equations. In Chapter 7, the Newton's method, the secant
	and Steffensen methods as well as their variations are discussed.
	Iterative methods for linear systems are generalized to and applied
	to nonlinear problems. Continuation methods for the study of existence
	problems of operator equations are also discussed. Chapter 8 is devoted
	to minimization problems, including the gradient and conjugate gradient
	iterations. \par Part IV (Chapters 9 to 11) discusses local convergence
	and convergence order of iterative processes. In Chapter 9 two different
	measures the $Q$- and $R$-factors of the asymptotic rate of convergence
	for sequences and iterative processes are introduced. Chapter 10
	presents results on local convergence and rate of convergence for
	one-step stationary iterations; for the Newton method, for the $m$-step
	Newton-SOR and $m$-step SOR-Newton and some of the minimization methods
	from Chapter 8. Chapter 11 considers multistep iteration methods
	as well as one-step nonstationary iterations to which the techniques
	from previous chapter do not apply. The main examples are secant-type
	methods, modified Newton iterations and variable-step generalized
	linear iterations. Results on point of attraction and rate of convergence
	are derived as well. \par Part V (Chapter 12 to 14) discusses problems
	on about existence of a solution $x^\ast $ to $Fx=0$ in the case
	of convergence of the iterations, about the choice of initial approximations
	for $x^\ast$ and on estimations of the error after stopping the iterations.
	Chapter 12 is devoted to generalizations of contraction mapping theorems,
	approximate contractions and sequences of contractions, nonlinear
	majorants of contractions. The results are applied to Newton's method.
	While Chapter 12 is based on the usage of norms in $\bbfR^n$, in
	Chapter 13 $\bbfR^n$ is considered to be a partially ordered linear
	space and all results show monotonic convergence of the iterates.
	The last Chapter 14 presents minimization methods for real functionals
	in $\bbfR^n$. Considered are gradient and gradient-related methods,
	Newton-type methods, conjugate direction methods, univariate relaxation
	processes. \par The first edition of the book was published in 1970
	(see Zbl 0241.65046). The present new edition is equipped with a
	Preface, where the authors indicate ``some of the principle developments
	and changes'' and give some recent books and papers related to topics
	considered.}},

	$C\sp 1$-mapping from $X$ into the dual $Y'$ of $Y$. For the problem
	(1) $\langle F(u)\vert v\rangle= 0$, $\forall v\in Y$, where $\langle\cdot

	Y$ are given subspaces such that $\dim X\sb h= \dim Y\sb h&lt; \infty$.
	A solution $u$ of (1) is assumed to exists for which the Fr\'echet
	derivative $DF(u)$ is an isomorphism from $X$ to $Y'$.\par Under
	consistency and stability conditions which, in essence, are linked
	to approximation properties of $X$ by $X\sb h$ and $Y$ by $Y\sb h$,
	and to discrete ``inf-sup'' conditions on the bilinear form $\langle

	$u\sb h$ in a neighbourhood of $u$. Moreover, a priori and a posteriori
	error estimates are established in the norm of $X$. The principal
	term in the a posteriori estimate is the residual $\Vert F(u\sb h)\Vert\sb{Y'}$

  abstract = {{Summary: Many of the tools of dynamical systems and control theory
	have gone largely unused for fluids, because the governing equations
	are so dynamically complex, both high-dimensional and nonlinear.
	Model reduction involves finding low-dimensional models that approximate
	the full high-dimensional dynamics. This paper compares three different
	methods of model reduction: proper orthogonal decomposition (POD),
	balanced truncation, and a method called balanced POD. Balanced truncation
	produces better reduced-order models than POD, but is not computationally
	tractable for very large systems. Balanced POD is a tractable method
	for computing approximate balanced truncations, that has computational
	cost similar to that of POD. The method presented here is a variation
	of existing methods using empirical Gramians, and the main contributions
	of the present paper are a version of the method of snapshots that
	allows one to compute balancing transformations directly, without
	separate reduction of the Gramians; and anoutput projection method,
	which allows tractable computation even when the number of outputs
	is large. The output projection method requires minimal additional
	computation, and has a priori error bounds that can guide the choice
	of rank of the projection. Connections between POD and balanced truncation
	are also illuminated: in particular, balanced truncation may be viewed
	as POD of a particular dataset, using the observability Gramian as
	an inner product. The three methods are illustrated on a numerical
	example, the linearized flow in a plane channel.}},

	of a control design process is given in the introduction (Ch. 1).
	Classical feedback control (Ch. 2), Introduction to multivariable
	control (Ch. 3) and Elements of linear system theory (Ch. 4) include
	standard topics with emphasis on classical frequency-domain methods
	and analysis of directions in multivariable systems using the singular
	value decomposition. Limitations of performance in SISO systems (Ch.
	5) and in MIMO systems (Ch. 6) summarize fundamental limitations
	on performance using the concept of input-output controllability
	analysis (inherent control limitations in the plant). Uncertainty
	and robustness for SISO systems (Ch. 7) and Robustness stability
	and performance analysis (Ch. 8) cover uncertainty representation
	by real and complex perturbations, robust stability analysis and
	performance using elementary methods for SISO systems, and for MIMO
	systems with multiple perturbations. The structured singular value
	$\mu$ is the main analysis tool. The ``optimal'' robust controller
	design in terms of minimizing $\mu$ is described using DK-iteration.
	Controller design (Ch. 9) presents practical procedures for multivariable
	controller design. Control structure design (Ch. 10) summarizes some
	basic concepts for large-scale system control structure selection
	and decentralized control. Model reduction (Ch. 11) describes methods
	for reducing the order of a plant or of a controller model. Case
	studies (Ch. 12) includes three case studies illustrating a number
	of important practical issues. Matrix theory and norms (A.A) is included
	as background material for the book. In Project work and sample exam
	(A.B), a project outline is given together with a sample exam. Numerous
	worked-out examples make frequent use of MATLAB. Most of the files
	use $\mu$ toolbox. MATLAB source files, files used to generate figures
	and tables, models for plants, corrections, errors, etc., \dots are

	both as an introductory graduate course and as an advanced undergraduate

	2nd ed.},

  year = {1998},
  author = {Sontag, Eduardo D.},
  address = {New York},
  abstract = {{This second edition (for a review of the first edition (1990), see
	Zbl 0703.93001) contains the following new items: \par 1) A chapter
	on nonlinear controllability on $R^p$ (the adopted language is not
	suitable for manifolds). Controllable and reachable sets to and from
	$x_0$ respectively have nonempty interior if a Lie algebra arising
	from vector fields defining the control system can be identified
	with $R^p$ at $x_0$. If in addition a defined reversibility condition
	holds, then $x_0$ belongs to the interior of the intersection of
	these two sets. Moreover, a criterion for complete controllability
	is obtained in this context. After devoting several pages to introduce
	and prove the Frobenius theorem, a converse to the first implication
	from above is provided when the conditions hold on possibly distinct
	open dense subsets of the state space. In the reviewer's opinion,
	it is unfortunate that the concept of strong accessibility and related
	criteria are not treated: it is an important situation in the gap
	between accessibility and controllability which provides deeper insight
	into what is going on. This information can be found in the book
	of {\it H. Nijmeijer} and {\it A. van der Schaft} [Nonlinear dynamical
	control systems (1990; Zbl 0701.93001)]. \par 2) A chapter is devoted
	to optimal control with constrained and unconstrained controls. The
	author obtains the extremum principle of Pontryagin and the Euler-Lagrange
	equation of the calculus of variations in a separate section. Another
	section deals with gradient-based numerical methods. \par 3) The
	minimum-time problem for linear systems is presented in a new chapter.
	The assumption is that the control set is convex and compact. The
	author shows that the reachability set in any time from any point
	is compact and convex through suitably defined weakly convergent
	sequences of control policies. Existence of an optimal control follows
	from the fact that the introduced reachability set is closed. The
	convexity of the reachability set is used to characterize final time
	optimal states on its boundary. This last situation is equivalent
	to an extremum principle and if an additional controllability type
	condition holds, the converse is true i.e. time-optimality is obtained
	from the boundary condition or the extremality principle. \par 4)
	A new section presents single input feedback linearization and nonlinear
	optimal stabilization is treated p. 390 via the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
	whose solution yields a value function for an optimization problem.
	This value function is a Lyapunov function. But this way of handling
	the problem is subject to plugging the right feedback in the Hamilton-Jacobi
	equation which will lead to a solution. Nonlinear stabilization is
	also introduced p. 239 where control Lyapunov functions and backstepping
	are presented. \par 5) Two sections deal with controllability in
	recurrent neural nets and controllability of linear systems with
	bounded controls. In the first case, the system is modelled by $$\dot
	x= \theta_n (Ax+Bu)$$ where $x\in R^n$ and $\theta_n$ is a diagonal
	mapping having each of its components acting as a saturation function
	modelled by the hyperbolic tangent. The main result is that local
	strong controllability around any state is equivalent to the condition
	that the rows of $B$ do not vanish nor do two rows coincide or are
	opposite. The result is obtained from a lemma interesting in its
	own sake: For the system $\dot x= f(x,u)$, if there is $x_0$ such
	that the origin belongs to the interior of the convex hull of the
	set of vectors $f(x_0,u)$ for $u$ in its admissible set, then there
	is a neighborhood of $x_0$ which is controllable to $x_0$ and reachable
	from $x_0$. The proof uses the analytic and asymptotic properties
	of the tangent hyperbolic function and is not trivial. In the case
	of bounded controls, it is shown that any point of the state space
	can be reached if and only if the system is controllable with an
	unstable drift. \par 6) The chapter on dynamic programming and $L-Q$
	problems has been revised. \par 7) ``Errors and typos have been corrected''
	(but there are some left) and a list of symbols has been added. \par
	This new edition gets closer to the impossible task of presenting
	a complete and rigorous panorama of control theory in a single book.
	It is one of the best source available with respect to these two
	qualities.}},

	author describes the general techniques for nonlinear partial differential
	equations that the he had developed, comprising, among others, the
	useful topics {\it homogenization}, {\it compensated compactness}
	and {\it H-measures}. Five lectures are explicitly devoted to or
	contain material connected with Sobolev spaces and the Sobolev embedding
	theorem. Explicitly stated theorems and lemmas are provided with

	style is a controversial and nowadays often disputed question, this

	topic it is dealing with. \par Another attractive feature of this
	book is the inclusion of short biographical data (given in footnotes)
	for all persons quoted in the text. Those of them, who the author
	had met or had/has collaborated with, are mentioned with their first

@BOOK{Tem95,
  title = {{Navier-Stokes equations and nonlinear functional analysis. 2nd ed.}},
  publisher = {SIAM},
  year = {1995},
  author = {Temam, Roger},
  abstract = {{As the title of the book indicates, the reader is assumed to be familiar
	with some basic concepts of (linear) functional analysis. E.g. selfadjoint
	operators and spaces such as $L^2(0, T; H^1(\Omega))$ etc. are steadily
	used; thus some familiarity with linear functional analysis such
	as contained in any classical textbook (Riesz-Nagy, Akhieser-Glasmann)
	is advisable. No knowledge of semigroup theory is required since
	this notion does not appear in the book. In fact, the book is to
	a certain extent selfcontained.\par It starts with a reminder of
	some basic concepts such as Sobolev spaces, and definitions of those
	spaces are given which are relevant for Navier- Stokes (N-S) theory.
	There is a preference for the space periodic case which can be handled
	by Fourier series computations and does not require the full apparatus
	of Sobolev space theory on arbitrary domains.\par This introduction
	is followed by a discussion of the linearized N-S equations (Stokes
	equations) which is again treated in the space periodic context via
	Fourier series. A digression then follows on the trilinear form $b(u,
	v, w)= \langle w, (u\nabla) v\rangle$ and some basic inequalities
	involving this form are derived for the periodic case. Based on these
	inequalities and the definitions of weak and strong solutions, fundamental
	(classical) existence (and for strong solutions) uniqueness results
	are proved for dimension $n= 2,3$. The reader is thereby immediately
	lead to the well-known unsolved problems in N-S theory which are
	still open even in the periodic case. As to nonperiodic domains,
	there are some remarks but in general the reader is referred to the
	author's book [Navier-Stokes equations, North Holland (1979; Zbl
	0522.35002)].\par In addition to the above material, further information
	is given on energy inequalities and singularities of weak solutions.
	Despite of its small size (120 pages) the book contains an astonishing
	amount of information. Thus, in addition to the above basic existence
	and uniqueness questions, a series of further topics are addressed,
	which will be briefly indicated in terms of key words: Couette-Taylor
	experiment, stationary solutions, squeezing property, Hausdorff dimension
	of attractors. The book concludes with a digression on numerical
	questions.\par The book is a highly recommendable introduction to
	the circle of questions associated with N-S theory, suited for everyone
	who wants to get acquainted with the mathematical structure of the
	field. Further texts must be consulted if the reader wants to pursue
	actual research.}},

  author = {Turek, Stefan},
  address = {Berlin},
  abstract = {{This book, mainly directed to professional CFD specialists, presents
	recent numerical and algorithmic tools for the solution of incompressible
	Navier-Stokes equations on modern computer platforms. The main feature
	of the book is a detailed description of the solution process for
	resulting large discrete systems of equations which is often neglected
	in the literature. The presentation covers a large amount of information,
	reflecting the scientific interests of the author and his colleagues
	from the FEAST fluid dynamics research group, Heidelberg University.\par
	The book consists of six chapters. A short introductory chapter 1
	``Motivation for current research" describes some recent results
	from a benchmark configuration (two- and three-dimensional flows
	around a cylinder). These results are critically discussed from the
	numerical and algorithmic points of view. Chapter 2 ``Derivation
	of Navier-Stokes solvers'' presents a large class of solvers based
	on local and global multilevel pressure Schur complements. The aim
	is to split strictly the tasks, namely to outline the outer control
	part responsible for the global convergence and accuracy, and the
	inner solver part which provides approximate solutions in a given
	discrete framework.\par Some modern discretization techniques and
	solution of discrete systems of equations are topics of the central
	chapter 3 modestly called ``Other mathematical components''. Here
	the author examines some finite element spaces, time stepping methods,
	boundary conditions, and finally gives a detailed treatment of nonlinear
	iterative and linear multigrid methods for discrete systems of equations.
	Chapter 4 ``Numerical comparison of Navier-Stokes solvers" uses exemplary
	numerical examples (nonsteady flow around a cylinder, stationary
	channel flow around a square, nonstationary flow through a Venturi
	pipe) to compare the merits and shortcomings of the solvers presented.
	This comparison is continued in the summarizing chapter 5 ``Conclusions
	and outlook''.\par The last chapter ``The enclosed CD-ROM" gives
	a brief description of the software added to the book. These include
	the complete FEATFLOW 1.1 package (tested on UNIX/LINUX platform,
	Fortran77 compiler required), and the ``Virtual Album of Fluid Motion''
	running also under Windows 9x, with a lot of impressive colour MPEG-format
	videos which enable the interested reader to perform his own simulations.\par
	On balance, the book is well organized, clearly and rigorously written,
	and can be very useful to the readers who are properly experienced
	in CFD.}},

	preconditioned by an inexact Newton solver derived from subproblem
	Jacobians. The method is demonstrated on several conjugate heat transfer
	problems modeled after melt crystal growth processes. These problems
	are represented by partitioned spatial regions, each modeled by independent
	heat transfer codes and linked by temperature and flux matching conditions
	at the boundaries common to the partitions. Whereas a typical block
	Gauss-Seidel iteration fails about half the time for the model problem,
	quadratic convergence is achieved by the ABN method under all conditions
	studied here. Additional performance advantages over existing methods
	are demonstrated and discussed.},

@BOOK{Zei90,
  title = {{Nonlinear functional analysis and its applications. II/B: Nonlinear
	monotone operators}},
  publisher = {Springer},
  year = {1990},
  author = {Zeidler, Eberhard},
  abstract = {{The second volume (chapters 18-36) of Zeidler's treatise is a broad
	and up-to-date survey of the monotone operator theory, a popular
	and successful research area of nonlinear analysis, over the past
	25 years. In comparison with the German original (1979; Zbl 0426.47032
	and 1981; Zbl 0481.47041) the number of pages of its English augmented
	translation has been increased five times; this compelled the publisher
	to divide the content into two subvolumes, which form a unit. The
	first subvolume, devoted to linear positive (monotone) operators,
	is a competent introduction to Hilbert space methods in PDE theory.
	As a prelude to the subject, Hilbert orthogonality and the Ritz method,
	as well as an elegant functional analytic foundation of quadratic
	variational problems are presented. More attention is paid to the
	Friedrichs extension for unbounded linear operators and its consequences
	for eigenvalue problems and the semigroup approach of evolution problems
	(mild solutions). Completion and smoothing principles and relationships
	between stability, consistency, and convergence in difference methods
	have been added. \par The second part of the first subvolume deals
	with the approximation- solvability of linear operator equations
	and the convergence of the Galerkin method. Hilbert space methods
	are successively implemented to elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic
	problems, whose peculiarities are emphasized. New topics on functional
	and interpolation inequalities, and regularity of generalized solutions
	are developed. Sufficient rules for strongly positive bilinear forms,
	existence of eigenvalues, and the Fredholm alternative are interacted
	to investigate the boundary value problems for elliptic equations.
	Along this perspective, the monotone mappings appear as a natural
	tool, extending Hilbert space methods to nonlinear problems. Moreover,
	monotone operator machinery yields a rigorous justification of the
	Dirichlet principle, based on the fundamental concept of energy.
	\par After a digest of the basic ideas in the theory of monotone
	operators, the second subvolume develops by progressive stages the
	implementation of monotone operators to stationary and nonstationary
	problems. Upon general hypotheses, quasilinear elliptic or nonlinear
	integral Hammerstein equations can be rewritten as functional equations
	involving monotone- like operators. Furthermore, the pseudomonotone
	operator theory unifies compactness and monotonicity arguments. With
	nonlinear Fredholm alternative are now associated noncoercive problems,
	the Ces\`ari method and the Landesman-Lazer principle, a main bifurcation
	theorem, as well as continuation and multiplicity results. The core
	of the second subvolume emphasizes the efficiency of monotonicity
	arguments, nonlinear semigroups and the Galerkin method in the study
	of nonlinear evolution equations. Kato's new results on semibounded
	evolutions, generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, or Amann's look
	at quasilinear parabolic problems regarded as dynamical systems are
	mentioned. A more constituent additional attribute of monotone operators
	is their maximality. Maximal monotone (set-valued) mappings have
	significant properties and applications to variational problems and
	inequalities or to Hammerstein equations. Their structure is based
	on both the Galerkin method and the regularization procedure via
	duality map. Special monotone mapping subclasses with nice features,
	such as angle-bounded and 3-monotone operators, are described. Key
	theorems about pseudomonotone perturbations of maximal monotone mappings
	and basic geometric elements concerning ranges of sums of monotone
	operators are inserted. Recent progress in semilinear wave equations
	and generalized viscosity solutions are interconnected with the Galerkin
	method for second-order evolution equations. Discretization methods,
	inner and external approximation schemes, for nonlinear equations
	are theorized in the last part of the volume. This leads naturally
	to the introduction of A-proper mappings, for which a multivalued
	topological degree is defined. For the convenience of the reader,
	an appendix summarizes the frequently used notion in measure and
	integration theory, discrete Sobolev spaces, functional calculus
	of selfadjoint operators, interpolation theory of function spaces,
	fractional powers of sectorial operators, Hausdorff measure and fractals,
	etc. Besides, many suggestive schematic overviews explain the interrelations
	between fundamental ideas, concepts and results in nonlinear operator
	theory. Since the proposed subject is too ample, the author has often
	chosen an intermediate way between monograph and directory. Each
	chapter closes with complementary problems and references, orienting
	the reader to current research trends. Moreover, a comprehensive
	bibliography of more than 40 pages concludes the book. Like in other
	previously published parts of this five-volume encyclopaedic series
	(Part I: 1986; Zbl 0583.47050; Part III: 1985; Zbl 0583.47051 and
	Part IV: 1988; Zbl 0648.47036), the lecturer enjoys reading the many
	quotations and remarks made by outstanding scientists or writers
	on the topics covered in the various chapters. It should also be
	emphasized that the author's approach goes straight to a numerical
	functional analysis with applications to finite elements methods
	in Sobolev spaces. \par All in all, this book is an excellent readable
	introduction in the prevalent classes of nonlinear operators. A large
	audience of mathematicians and natural scientists will find it a
	stimulating guide through the contemporary operator treatment of
	nonlinear partial differential and integral equations.}},

  abstract = {{The five volumes (100 chapters) of this treatise are devoted to:
	I) Fixed-point theorems, II) Monotone operators, III) Variational
	methods and optimization (see next review), IV-V) Applications in
	mathematical physics, and are the result of the author's wide experience
	as a researcher and educator involved in the solvability of operator
	equations. The first three volumes are a translated extension of
	the German original [(1976; Zbl 0326.47053 and 1980; Zbl 0434.47042)].
	Although the titles of the chapters are changed according to the
	new enlarged content, the succession of the basic topics is almost
	unaltered. That is why, after some general considerations on the
	entire work, we will point out only certain augmented sections which
	we feel to be more significant in contemporary nonlinar analysis.
	As distinct from the lecture note schemes of the German version,
	every chapter in the English translation has a flowing, coherent
	form and contains nice comments, overviews, and perspectives on the
	strategy and implementations of the considered procedures, and is
	concluded with complementary problems. Moreover, at the end of each
	volume there is a comprehensive and up-to- date bibliography. \par
	The work is clearly written and organized so that each chapter can
	be independently approached. The survey of the basic features of
	most topics of nonlinear functional analysis makes Zeidler's treatise,
	more than any other recent books concerning this subject, a deskbook
	for a broad range of researchers as well as a guide for many graduate
	courses. \par The first volume (chapters 1-17) describes what fixed-point
	theory actually means. In the part that deals with general principles
	and applications, more emphasis is placed on iterative methods, generalizations
	of the implicit function theorem, super- and subsolutions, the nonlinear
	Krein-Rutman theorem, multiple solutions, the Ljapunov-Schmidt branching
	equations, the generic and Hopf bifurcation, minimax theorems, Michael's
	selection theorem and differential inclusions, the Bourbaki-Kneser
	theorem. In the context of the degree theory one also studies the

  abstract = { In the standard formulation of the population balance equation that
	consists of breakage terms, significant loss of mass is observed
	for the dispersed phase. This mass loss is actually caused by the
	inexact conservation property reflected by many breakage kernels;
	hence, incorrect physical interpretations of the model simulations
	may be drawn. In this work, a constrained method is developed enforcing
	mass conservation. This numerical property is accomplished by adding
	an extra restriction to the original population balance equation
	in terms of the dispersed phase continuity equation through the Lagrange
	multipliers strategy. The discretized system resulting from applying
	the method to a two-phase population balance equation problem is
	symmetric and pseudopositive definite. Numerical experiments are
	carried out simulating the motion of a two-phase mixture passing
	through a 2D domain. The results obtained by the modified least-squares
	spectral element method show that the mass is conserved everywhere
	in the domain with high accuracy. },
